The VEX Pipeline System complements our existing storage terminal and dock at the Port of Victoria, where with our crude oil marketing segment, we control approximately 450,000 barrels of storage with three docks.\nThrough 2021, pipeline and storage segment revenues were earned from a third-party shipper under a contract that had been in place at the time of the acquisition, and revenues were also earned from GulfMark, an affiliated shipper. The third-party contract ended in 2021, and all pipeline and storage segment revenues through mid-2023 were earned from GulfMark. In mid-2023, we began receiving revenue from an unaffiliated shipper. We are also currently constructing a new pipeline connection between the VEX Pipeline System and the Max Midstream pipeline system, and we expect to complete construction and place the assets into commercial service during the second half of 2024. In addition, we are exploring new connections with several other pipeline systems, for new crude oil supply opportunities both upstream and downstream of the pipeline, to enhance the crude oil supply and take-away capability of the system.\nVolume information was as follows for the periods indicated (in barrels per day):\nThe VEX Pipeline System, with truck and storage terminals at both Cuero and the Port of Victoria, Texas, is a crude oil and condensate pipeline system, which connects the heart of the Eagle Ford Basin to the Gulf Coast waterborne market. The VEX Pipeline System includes 56 miles of 12-inch pipeline, which spans DeWitt County to Port of Victoria in Victoria County, Texas, with approximately 400,000 barrels of above ground storage at its two terminals. The pipeline system has a current capacity of 90,000 barrels per day and is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d) and the Texas Railroad Commission. The VEX Pipeline System can receive crude oil by pipeline and truck, and has downstream pipeline connections to two terminals today, with potential for additional downstream connection opportunities in the future.\nThe Cuero terminal has 40,000 barrels per day of offload capacity via eight truck unloading stations, with two 100,000-barrel storage tanks and one 16,000-barrel storage tank. The Port of Victoria terminal has 30,000 barrels per day of truck offload capacity via six truck unloading stations and water access via two barge docks, which have been leased from the Port Authority in Victoria. The Port of Victoria has four 50,000-barrel storage tanks and one 10,000-barrel storage tank.\nThe VEX Pipeline System supports GulfMark\u2019s Gulf Coast region crude oil supply and marketing business and integrates into GulfMark\u2019s value chain, serving as the link between producers/operators and our end-user markets we supply directly along the Gulf Coast waterborne market.

We do not own any of the products that we haul through Firebird; rather we act as a third-party carrier to deliver our customers\u2019 products from point A to point B, using predominately our employees and our owned or leased tractors and trailers. However, we also use contracted independent owner-operators to provide transportation services. Firebird provides transportation services to customers under multiple load contracts in addition to loads covered under its standard price list. Our customers include major oil and chemical companies and large and mid-sized industrial companies. Firebird provides transportation services to Phoenix, and crude oil transportation services to GulfMark, when additional trucking capacity is required.\nPhoenix is also headquartered in Humble, Texas. Phoenix repurposes and finds beneficial uses for off-specification fuels, lubricants, crude oil and other chemicals from producers in the U.S. With an advanced laboratory, sophisticated technology, and access to an expansive fleet of trucks, Phoenix can provide a solution for customers needing help managing off-specification fuels or oils. In addition to the removal from the customer site, Phoenix markets these refinery and plant co-products into the fuels or feedstock markets. Phoenix markets on approximately six different levels, ranging from heavy fuel oils to light-end naphthas. Phoenix utilizes Firebird\u2019s fleet to assist in the transportation of these products, and has begun to utilize STC to also assist in the transportation of these products.\nOn May 4, 2023, we acquired approximately 10.6 acres of land in the Gulf Inland Industrial Park, located in Dayton, Texas, for approximately $1.8 million to build a new processing facility for Phoenix with rail spur and siding, product storage, and truck rack. Phoenix intends to build new infrastructure to service its existing customers and to create opportunities for growing the business. Phoenix also plans to relocate its headquarters from Humble, Texas to this new location. We expect to break ground on the Dayton facility during the second quarter of 2024.

In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the EPA\u2019s authority to regulate GHG emissions. Pursuant to EPA regulations, a permit governing GHG emission may be required, in conjunction with authorization of emissions of other pollutants. The EPA also requires, pursuant to its GHG Reporting Rule, specified large GHG emission sources to report their GHG emissions. Regulated sources include, without limitation, onshore and offshore crude oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore crude oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. Reporting of GHG emissions from such large facilities is required on an annual basis. We do not presently operate any such large GHG emissions sources, but if we were to do so, we would incur costs associated with evaluating and meeting this reporting obligation.\nOur industry is subject to regular enactment of new or amended federal, state, and local environmental health and safety statutes, regulation, and ballot initiatives, as well as judicial decisions interpreting these requirements, which have become more stringent over time. We expect these trends to continue, which could lead to material increases in our costs for future environmental, health, and safety compliance. These requirements may also impose substantial capital and operating costs and operational limitations on us and may adversely affect our business.\nRegulation of methane and volatile organic compound (\u201cVOC\u201d) emissions has varied significantly between recent administrations, but regulation of these emissions is becoming increasingly stringent. Increased regulatory oversight by the EPA may result in increased compliance costs for our business. More directly, these costs may extend to our customers and the industry as a whole, which could lead to a diminution in our customers\u2019 business and their exploration and production activities, and ultimately detrimentally affect our business.\nRegulation of menthane and VOC emissions from oil and gas operation in particular is becoming more pervasive and comprehensive. In December 2023, EPA issued a final rule to further regulate methane emissions and VOCs from oil and gas industry sources\u2014implementing regulations known as OOOOb and OOOOc. The rule includes a comprehensive suite of pollution reduction standards including, among others, the creation of a new New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for oil and gas industry sources; a requirement that all well sites and compressor stations be routinely monitored for leaks; and the creation of what is known as a Super Emitter Program that authorizes third parties to remotely monitor regulated facilities and notify EPA when certain significant methane releases occur. Under OOOOb, a new NSPS includes generally more stringent standards for \u201cnew\u201d emission sources not regulated previously under the previous rules\u2014this being any facility constructed, reconstructed, or modified after December 6, 2022. Under OOOOc, the rule includes the first oil and gas emission guidelines for existing sources, which requires states to enforce standards largely consistent with those of Subpart OOOOb on existing oil and gas emissions sources. The state implementation plans are required to be submitted within two years of the rule\u2019s finalization and regulated entities will be required to comply within three years of the submittal deadline.\nThese rules may require us and the industry to expend material sums on compliance, including equipment repair, replacement, and monitoring, which may reduce overall industry activity and demands which could have an adverse impact on our business. Further, states may adopt laws or regulations more stringent than the federal rules, which would remain in place regardless of the outcome of any federal rules stay or litigation, thus potentially causing additional impact on our business and the industry as a whole, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) has similarly promulgated proposed and final methane emission rulemakings, which also seek to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during crude oil and natural gas operations on public lands. The increased regulation of the oil and gas industry\u2019s operations could adversely affect our business, our customers\u2019 business, and others. The heightened standards may increase the cost to our customers in delivering hydrocarbons and, as a result, may result in a diminution of product transported and our business generally. 21\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and many states and regions have already taken legal measures to reduce or measure GHG emission levels, often involving the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances. Generally, the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to reduce overall GHG emissions, and the cost of these allowances could escalate significantly over time. In the markets in which we currently operate, our operations are not materially affected by such GHG cap and trade programs. On an international level, almost 200 nations agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and to be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. Although the U.S. withdrew from the Paris accord in November 2020, it rejoined under the new administration in February 2021. Further, several states and local governments remain committed to the principles of the international climate agreement in their effectuation of policy and regulations. It is not possible at this time to predict how or when the U.S. might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the international climate change agreement. The adoption and implementation of any legislation or regulatory programs imposing GHG reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations including costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our GHG emissions, pay any taxes related to GHG emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program. Such programs also could adversely affect demand for the crude oil that we market and transport.\nGenerally, the promulgation of climate change laws or regulations restricting or regulating GHG emissions from our operations could increase our costs to operate by increasing control technology requirements or changing regulatory obligations. In the United States, the EPA\u2019s current and proposed regulation of GHG emissions may result in an increased cost of our operations as well as that of our customers, which in either case could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to the regulation of operations, the SEC has adopted disclosure rules in March 2024 that will generally require public companies, after a transition period, to disclose climate-related risks and impacts, mitigation or adaptation activities, board oversight of climate-related risks, capitalized costs, expenses and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, and other climate-related information, and will require many public companies to monitor and report direct GHG emissions and indirect GHG emissions from the purchase of energy. Even though we will be exempt from the more onerous emissions-related disclosure requirements for so long as we continue to qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the rules may impose substantial compliance costs on our business, the impact of which we are currently unable to quantify.", "content": []}]}, {"title": "The Inflation Reduction Act may have implications for our customers and our business operations.", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\u201cIR Act\u201d) put in place broad-reaching tax, loan, incentive and other programs.

The average crude oil price was $92.63 per barrel for 2022, which decreased to $74.96 per barrel for 2023. Revenues from our volumes are mostly based upon the market price in our market areas, primarily in the Gulf Coast. The decrease in the market price of crude oil during 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily due to weakness in the Chinese economy and concern over economic recession, which caused crude oil prices to fall. During the third quarter of 2023, OPEC oil production cuts and U.S. inventory draws from the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast resulted in an increase in crude oil prices.\nRevenues also decreased due to the termination on October 31, 2023 and non-renewal of our five year purchase contract in North Texas and South Central Oklahoma (the \u201cRed River area\u201d). In October 2018, we acquired a trucking company that owned approximately 113 tractors and 126 trailers operating in the Red River area, and subsequently entered into a new revenue agreement at that time. During the five year period, volumes handled in the Red River area ranged from an average of 25,000 to 28,000 barrels per day. The purchase price for Red River area volumes was based on a contractual price for volumes in North Texas and Oklahoma, which had been slightly lower than the purchase price for legacy volumes. The termination of this contract has resulted in a decrease in the average crude oil volumes for the crude oil marketing segment beginning in November 2023.\nDriver compensation remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022, despite a decrease in the overall driver count in 2023.

The average crude oil price was $65.48 for 2021, which increased to $92.63 for 2022. Revenues from our volumes are mostly based upon the market price in our market areas, primarily in the Gulf Coast. The market price of crude oil increased during 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily as a result of a return of global crude oil demand following the pandemic, which combined with a perceived shortage of global crude oil production. In addition, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia contributed to an increase in the market price of crude oil in the first half of 2022.

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606.

Recognized valuation techniques employ inputs such as contractual prices, quoted market prices or rates, operating costs, discount factors and business growth rates. These inputs may be either readily observable, corroborated by market data or generally unobservable. In developing our estimates of fair value, we endeavor to utilize the best information available and apply market-based data to the highest extent possible. Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques (such as the market approach) that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nA three-tier hierarchy has been established that classifies fair value amounts recognized in the financial statements based on the observability of inputs used to estimate such fair values. The hierarchy considers fair value amounts based on observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) to be more reliable and predictable than those based primarily on unobservable inputs (Level 3). At each balance sheet reporting date, we categorize our financial assets and liabilities using this hierarchy.\nThe characteristics of the fair value amounts classified within each level of the hierarchy are described as follows:\n\u2022 Level 1 fair values are based on quoted prices, which are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. Active markets are defined as those in which transactions for identical assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency so as to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Finance leases are included in property and equipment, current liabilities and long-term finance lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.

As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments that approximates the rate of interest we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term. At adoption, the ROU asset also includes any lease payment made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe are a lessee in noncancellable (i) operating leases for office space, equipment and lease and terminal access contracts for tank storage and dock access for our crude oil marketing business, and (ii) finance leases for tractors, trailers, a tank storage and throughput arrangement in our crude oil marketing business and office equipment.

On October 1, 2023, the self-insurance retention was increased to $ 1.5 million for the auto policy. Insurance is purchased over our retention to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events.

Estimates are based on adjusters\u2019 estimates, historical experience and statistical methods commonly used within the insurance industry that we believe are reliable. We have also engaged a third-party actuary to perform a review of our accrued liability for these claims as well as potential funded losses in our captive insurance company. Insurance estimates include certain assumptions and management judgments regarding the frequency and severity of claims, claim development and settlement practices and the selection of estimated loss among estimates derived using different methods. Unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense that would be reported under these programs.\nOn October 1, 2020, we elected to utilize a wholly owned insurance captive to insure the self-insured retention for our workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and automobile liability insurance programs. All accrued liabilities associated with periods from October 1, 2017 through current were transferred to the captive.\nWe maintain excess property and casualty programs with third-party insurers in an effort to limit the financial impact of significant events covered under these programs. Our operating subsidiaries pay premiums to both the excess and reinsurance carriers and our captive for the estimated losses based on an external actuarial analysis. These premiums held by our wholly owned captive are currently held in a restricted account, resulting in a transfer of risk from our operating subsidiaries to the captive.\nWe also maintain a self-insurance program for managing employee medical claims in excess of employee deductibles. As claims are paid, the liability is relieved. We also maintain third party insurance stop-loss coverage for individual medical claims exceeding a certain minimum threshold .
