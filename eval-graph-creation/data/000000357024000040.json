BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES", "text": "", "content": [{"title": "General", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "Cheniere, a Delaware corporation, is a Houston-based energy infrastructure company primarily engaged in LNG-related businesses. We provide clean, secure and affordable LNG to integrated energy companies, utilities and energy trading companies around the world. We aspire to conduct our business in a safe and responsible manner, delivering a reliable, competitive and integrated source of LNG to our customers.\nLNG is natural gas (methane) in liquid form. The LNG we produce is shipped all over the world, turned back into natural gas (called \u201cregasification\u201d) and then transported via pipeline to homes and businesses and used as an energy source that is essential for heating, cooking, other industrial uses and back up for intermittent energy sources. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning, abundant and affordable source of energy. When LNG is converted back to natural gas, it can be used instead of coal, which reduces the amount of pollution traditionally produced from burning fossil fuels, like sulfur dioxide and particulate matter that enters the air we breathe. Additionally, compared to coal, it produces significantly fewer carbon emissions. By liquefying natural gas, we are able to reduce its volume by 600 times so that we can load it onto special LNG carriers designed to keep the LNG cold and in liquid form for efficient transport overseas.\nWe are the largest producer of LNG in the United States and the second largest LNG operator globally, based on the total production capacity of our liquefaction facilities, which totals approximately 45 mtpa as of December 31, 2023.\nWe own and operate a natural gas liquefaction and export facility located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana at Sabine Pass (the \u201cSabine Pass LNG Terminal\u201d ), one of the largest LNG production facilities in the world, through our ownership interest in and management agreements with CQP, which is a publicly traded limited partnership that we formed in 2007. As of December 31, 2023, we owned 100% of the general partner interest, a 48.6% limited partner interest and 100% of the incentive distribution rights of CQP. The Sabine Pass LNG Terminal has six operational Trains, for a total production capacity of approximately 30 mtpa of LNG (the \u201cSPL Project\u201d ). The Sabine Pass LNG Terminal also has operational regasification facilities that include five LNG storage tanks with aggregate capacity of approximately 17 Bcfe and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately 4 Bcf/d, as well as three marine berths, two of which can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters and the third berth which can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 200,000 cubic meters. We also own and operate through CTPL, a subsidiary of CQP, a 94-mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal with several interstate and intrastate pipelines (the \u201cCreole Trail Pipeline\u201d ).\nAdditionally, we own and operate a natural gas liquefaction and export facility located near Corpus Christi, Texas (the \u201cCorpus Christi LNG Terminal\u201d ) through CCL, which has natural gas liquefaction facilities consisting of three operational Trains for a total production capacity of approximately 15 mtpa of LNG, three LNG storage tanks with aggregate capacity of approximately 10 Bcfe and two marine berths that can each accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters. We are constructing an expansion of the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal (the \u201cCorpus Christi Stage 3 Project\u201d ) for seven midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of over 10 mtpa of LNG. We also own and operate through CCP a 21.5-mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal with several interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines (the \u201cCorpus Christi Pipeline\u201d and together with the Trains, storage tanks, and marine berths at the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal and the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project, the \u201cCCL Project\u201d ).\nOur long-term customer arrangements form the foundation of our business and provide us with significant, stable, long-term cash flows. We have contracted substantially all of our anticipated production capacity under SPAs, in which our customers are generally required to pay a fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes irrespective of their election to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, and under IPM agreements, in which the gas producer sells natural gas to us on a global LNG or natural gas index price, less a fixed liquefaction fee, shipping and other costs. The SPAs also have a variable fee component, which is generally structured to cover the cost of natural gas purchases, transportation and liquefaction fuel consumed to produce LNG. Since we procure most of our feedstock for LNG production from the U.S., the structure of these contracts helps limit our exposure to fluctuations in U.S. natural gas prices. Through our SPAs and IPM agreements, we have contracted approximately 95% of the total anticipated production from the SPL Project and the CCL Project (collectively, the \u201cLiquefaction Projects\u201d ) through the mid-2030s with approximately 16 years of weighted average remaining life as of\nDecember 31, 2023, excluding volumes from contracts with terms less than 10 years and volumes that are contractually subject to additional liquefaction capacity beyond what is currently in construction or operation. We also market and sell LNG produced by the Liquefaction Projects that is not contracted by CCL or SPL through our integrated marketing function.\nWe remain focused on safety, operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Increasing demand for LNG has allowed us to expand our liquefaction infrastructure in a financially disciplined manner. We have increased available liquefaction capacity at our Liquefaction Projects as a result of debottlenecking and other optimization projects. We believe these factors provide a foundation for additional growth in our portfolio of customer contracts in the future. We hold significant land positions at both the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal and the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal, which provide opportunity for further liquefaction capacity expansion. In March 2023, certain of our subsidiaries submitted an application with the FERC under the Natural Gas Act (the \u201cNGA\u201d ) for an expansion adjacent to the CCL Project consisting of two midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of approximately 3 mtpa of LNG (the \u201cCCL Midscale Trains 8 & 9 Project\u201d ). Additionally, in May 2023, certain subsidiaries of CQP entered the pre-filing review process with the FERC under the National Environmental Policy Act ( \u201cNEPA\u201d ) for an expansion adjacent to the SPL Project with a potential production capacity of up to approximately 20 mtpa of total LNG capacity, inclusive of estimated debottlenecking opportunities (the \u201cSPL Expansion Project\u201d ).

Under the NGA, the FERC\u2019s jurisdiction generally extends to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce, to natural gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale and to the construction, operation, maintenance and expansion of LNG terminals and interstate natural gas pipelines.\nThe FERC\u2019s authority to regulate interstate natural gas pipelines and the services that they provide generally includes regulation of:\n\u2022 rates and charges, and terms and conditions for natural gas transportation, storage and related services;\n\u2022 the certification and construction of new facilities and modification of existing facilities;\n\u2022 the extension and abandonment of services and facilities;\n\u2022 the administration of accounting and financial reporting regulations, including the maintenance of accounts and records;\n\u2022 the acquisition and disposition of facilities;\n\u2022 the initiation and discontinuation of services; and\n\u2022 various other matters.\nUnder the NGA, our pipelines are not permitted to unduly discriminate or grant undue preference as to rates or the terms and conditions of service to any shipper, including our own marketing affiliates. Those rates, terms and conditions must be public, and on file with the FERC. In contrast to pipeline regulation, the FERC does not require LNG terminal owners to provide open-access services at cost-based or regulated rates. Although the provisions that codified the FERC\u2019s policy in this area expired on January 1, 2015, we see no indication that the FERC intends to change its policy in this area. On February 18, 2022, the FERC updated its 1999 Policy Statement on certification of new interstate natural gas facilities and the framework for the FERC\u2019s decision-making process, modifying the standards that the FERC uses to evaluate applications to include, among other things, reasonably foreseeable greenhouse gas ( \u201cGHG\u201d ) emissions that may be attributable to the project and the project\u2019s impact on environmental justice communities. On March 24, 2022, the FERC rescinded the Policy Statement, re-issued it as a draft and it remains pending. At this time, we do not expect it to have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are permitted to make sales of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce pursuant to a blanket marketing certificate granted by the FERC with the issuance of our Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to our marketing affiliates. Our sales of natural gas will be affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. As noted above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation.\nIn order to site, construct and operate our LNG terminals, we received and are required to maintain authorizations from the FERC under Section 3 of the NGA as well as other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the \u201cEPAct\u201d ) amended Section 3 of the NGA to establish or clarify the FERC\u2019s exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting, construction, expansion or operation of LNG terminals, unless specifically provided otherwise in the EPAct amendments to the NGA. For example, nothing in the EPAct amendments to the NGA were intended to affect otherwise applicable law related to any other federal agency\u2019s authorities or responsibilities related to LNG terminals or those of a state acting under federal law.\nIn March 2023, certain of our subsidiaries submitted an application with the FERC under the NGA for the CCL Midscale Trains 8 & 9 Project. In May 2023, certain subsidiaries of CQP entered the pre-filing review process with the FERC under the NEPA for the SPL Expansion Project.\nThe FERC\u2019s Standards of Conduct apply to interstate pipelines that conduct transmission transactions with an affiliate that engages in natural gas marketing functions. The general principles of the FERC Standards of Conduct are: (1) independent functioning, which requires transmission function employees to function independently of marketing function employees; (2) no-conduit rule, which prohibits passing transmission function information to marketing function employees; and (3) transparency, which imposes posting requirements to detect undue preference due to the improper disclosure of non-public transmission function information. We have established the required policies, procedures and training to comply with the FERC\u2019s Standards of Conduct.\nAll of our FERC construction, operation, reporting, accounting and other regulated activities are subject to audit by the FERC, which may conduct routine or special inspections and issue data requests designed to ensure compliance with FERC rules, regulations, policies and procedures. The FERC\u2019s jurisdiction under the NGA allows it to impose civil and criminal penalties for any violations of the NGA and any rules, regulations or orders of the FERC up to approximately $1.3 million per day per violation, including any conduct that violates the NGA\u2019s prohibition against market manipulation.\nSeveral other governmental and regulatory approvals and permits are required throughout the life of our LNG terminals and our pipelines. In addition, our FERC orders require us to comply with certain ongoing conditions, reporting obligations and maintain other regulatory agency approvals throughout the life of our facilities. For example, throughout the life of our LNG terminals and our pipelines, we are subject to regular reporting requirements to the FERC, the Department of Transportation\u2019s ( \u201cDOT\u201d ) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ( \u201cPHMSA\u201d ) and applicable federal and state regulatory agencies regarding the operation and maintenance of our facilities.

Although it is not expected to occur, the loss of an export authorization could be a force majeure event under our SPAs.\nUnder Section 3 of the NGA, applications for exports of natural gas to FTA countries, which allow for national treatment for trade in natural gas, are \u201cdeemed to be consistent with the public interest\u201d and shall be granted by the DOE without \u201cmodification or delay.\u201d FTA countries currently recognized by the DOE for exports of LNG include Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Peru, Republic of Korea and Singapore. FTAs with Israel and Costa Rica do not require national treatment for trade in natural gas. Applications for export of LNG to non-FTA countries are considered by the DOE in a notice and comment proceeding whereby the public and other interveners are provided the opportunity to comment and may assert that such authorization would not be consistent with the public interest. In January 2024, the Biden Administration announced a temporary pause on pending decisions on exports of LNG to non-FTA countries until the DOE can update the underlying analyses for authorizations. We do not believe such a pause will have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, or liquidity.

These factors include changes in worldwide supply and demand for natural gas, LNG and substitute products, the relative prices for natural gas, crude oil and substitute products in North America and international markets, the extent of energy security needs in the EU and elsewhere, the rate of fuel switching for power generation from coal, nuclear or oil to natural gas and other overarching factors such as global economic growth and the pace of any transition from fossil-based systems of energy production and consumption to alternative energy sources. In addition, our ability to obtain additional funding to execute our business strategy is subject to the investment community\u2019s appetite for investment in LNG and natural gas infrastructure and our ability to access capital markets.\nWe expect that global demand for natural gas and LNG will continue to increase as nations seek more abundant, reliable and environmentally cleaner fuel alternatives to oil and coal. Market participants around the globe have shown commitments to environmental goals consistent with many policy initiatives that we believe are constructive for LNG demand and infrastructure growth. Currently, significant amounts of money are being invested across Europe, Asia and Latin America in natural gas projects under construction, and more continues to be earmarked to planned projects globally. In Europe, there are various plans to install more than 85 mtpa of import capacity over the near-term to secure access to LNG and displace Russian gas imports. In India, there are more than 11,000 kilometers of gas pipelines under construction to expand the gas distribution network and increase access to natural gas. And in China, billions of U.S. dollars have already been invested and hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars are expected to be further invested all along the natural gas value chain to enable growth and decrease harmful emissions. Furthermore, some of the existing integrated liquefaction facilities outside of the U.S. have been experiencing issues related to reduced feed gas as a result of depleting upstream resources. Global supply contributions from these plants have been decreasing and LNG supply growth is expected to help support these shortages.\nAs a result of these dynamics, we expect natural gas and LNG to continue to play an important role in satisfying energy demand going forward. In its forecast published in the third quarter of 2023, Wood Mackenzie Limited ( \u201cWoodMac\u201d ) forecasted that global demand for LNG would increase by approximately 60%, from approximately 411 mtpa, or 19.7 Tcf, in 2022, to 657 mtpa, or 31.5 Tcf, in 2040 and to 709 mtpa or 34 Tcf in 2050. In its forecast published in the third quarter of 2023, WoodMac also forecasted LNG production from existing operational facilities and new facilities already under construction would be able to supply the market with approximately 544 mtpa in 2040, declining to 477 mtpa in 2050. This could result in a market need for construction of an additional approximately 113 mtpa of LNG production by 2040 and about 231 mtpa by 2050. As a cleaner burning fuel with lower emissions than coal or liquid fuels in power generation, we expect natural gas and LNG to play a central role in balancing grids, serving as back up for intermittent energy sources and contributing to a low carbon energy system globally. We believe the capital and operating costs of the uncommitted capacity of our Liquefaction Projects, as well as our proposed expansions at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, are competitive with new proposed projects globally and we are well-positioned to capture a portion of this incremental market need.\nWe have limited exposure to oil price movements as we have contracted a significant portion of our LNG production capacity under long-term sale and purchase agreements indexed to Henry Hub. These agreements contain fixed fees that are required to be paid even if the customers elect to cancel or suspend delivery of LNG cargoes. Through our SPAs and IPM agreements, we have contracted approximately 95% of the total anticipated production from the Liquefaction Projects through the mid-2030s with approximately 16 years of weighted average remaining life as of December 31, 2023, excluding volumes 13\nfrom contracts with terms less than 10 years and volumes that are contractually subject to additional liquefaction capacity beyond what is currently in construction or operation.", "content": [{"title": "Competition", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "Despite the long term nature of our SPAs, when SPL, CCL or our integrated marketing function need to replace or amend any existing SPA or enter into new SPAs, they will compete with each other and other natural gas liquefaction projects throughout the world on the basis of price per contracted volume of LNG at that time. Revenues associated with any incremental volumes, including those sold by our integrated marketing function, will also be subject to market-based price competition.

In addition, certain laws and regulations authorize regulators having jurisdiction over the construction and operation of our LNG terminals, docks and pipelines, including FERC, PHMSA, EPA and the United States Coast Guard, to issue regulatory enforcement actions, which may restrict or limit operations or increase compliance or operating costs. Violation of these laws and regulations could lead to substantial liabilities, compliance orders, fines and penalties, difficulty obtaining and maintaining permits from regulatory agencies or increased capital expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.

Further, the IRA includes a charge on methane emissions above certain emissions thresholds employing empirical emissions data that will apply to our facilities beginning in calendar year 2024. In January 2024, the EPA issued a proposed rule to impose and collect methane emissions charges authorized under the IRA. In addition, other international, federal and state initiatives may be considered in the future to address GHG emissions through treaty commitments, direct regulation, market-based regulations such as a GHG emissions tax or cap-and-trade programs or clean energy or performance-based standards. Such initiatives could affect the demand for or cost of natural gas, which we consume at our terminals, or could increase compliance costs for our operations.\nRevised, reinterpreted or additional guidance, laws and regulations at local, state, federal or international levels that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating or construction costs and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.

Price levels started moving towards pre-Russia-Ukraine war levels in the second quarter of 2023 and have for the most part normalized versus pre-war levels, as concerns about physical market tightness dissipated. However, extensive upstream maintenance in Norway and concerns about tight supply capacity amid strike threats in Australia elevated prices during the third quarter of 2023 and brought some volatility back to the market, albeit not at much lower levels than those seen in 2022. These conditions were quickly resolved, and winter prices remained within a more normal level, despite the eruption of military conflict in the Middle East in October.\nThe TTF monthly settlement prices averaged $13.73/MMBtu in 2023, over 66% lower year-over-year and 4.6% lower than 2021. Similarly, the 2023 average settlement price for the Japan Korea Marker ( \u201cJKM\u201d ) decreased 53% year-over-year to an average of $16.13/MMBtu in 2023. Prices in the fourth quarter of 2023 also decreased, with TTF averaging $13.66/MMBtu and JKM $14.97/MMBtu - both significantly below levels seen in the previous two years. The Henry Hub benchmark also witnessed a similar year-over-year drop albeit from a much lower base. The Henry Hub average settlement price in 2023 was $2.74, down approximately 59% from $6.64/MMBtu in 2022 during the height of the energy crisis in Europe.\nThe U.S. played a significant role in balancing the global market in 2023, exporting approximately 86 million tonnes of LNG, a gain of approximately 13% from 2022, due in part to the return of Freeport LNG to operations. Exports from our Liquefaction Projects reached 44 million tonnes in aggregate, representing over 50% of total U.S. exports for the year, according to Kpler data.\nGlobal LNG demand grew by approximately 3% from 2022, adding 10.5 million tonnes to the overall market. Although overall Asian demand has increased from 2022, weakness in Japan, mainly due to improved nuclear availability, along with continued gas demand destruction in Europe, especially in the residential sector, exerted downward pressure on the market and kept LNG and gas prices from increasing. Despite the decrease in Japanese demand, which was down approximately 8% or 6 mtpa year-over-year, Asia\u2019s LNG imports increased roughly 4% year-over-year in 2023 to approximately 263 mtpa. This uptick was largely due to an approximately 8.4 mtpa year-over-year growth in South and Southeast Asia\u2019s demand and a modest rebound in China\u2019s economy, which resulted in approximately 12% or 7.5 mtpa increase in LNG imports into the 35\ncountry. In Europe, despite continued declines in gas demand, LNG imports were flat year-over-year as pipeline flows from Russia to the EU remained low at 27 billion cubic meters ( \u201cBcm\u201d ), down 36 Bcm or 57% year-over-year.\nThe market dynamics brought on by the need to displace and replace Russian gas into Europe in 2023 resulted in a notable uptick in long-term LNG contracting and a push for LNG project FIDs. Commercial activity in 2023 continued to build on last year\u2019s momentum with executed long-term SPAs in the U.S. reaching approximately 23 mtpa for the year, of which our SPAs and IPM agreements totaled approximately 6.5 mtpa.

Substantially all of our future revenues are contracted under SPAs and because many of these contracts have long-term durations, we are contractually entitled to significant future consideration under these contracts which has not yet been recognized as revenue. This future consideration is, in most cases, not yet legally due to us and was not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023. In addition, a significant portion of this future consideration is subject to variability as discussed more specifically below. We anticipate that this consideration will be available to meet liquidity needs in the future. The following table summarizes our estimate of future material sources of liquidity to be received from executed SPAs as of December 31, 2023 (in billions):\n(1) Agreements in force as of December 31, 2023 that have terms dependent on project milestone dates are based on the estimated dates as of December 31, 2023. The timing of revenue recognition under GAAP may not align with cash receipts, although we do not consider the timing difference to be material. We may enter into contracts to sell LNG that are conditioned upon one or both of the parties achieving certain milestones such as reaching FID on a certain liquefaction Train, obtaining financing or achieving substantial completion of a Train and any related facilities. These contracts are included in the revenues above when the conditions are considered probable of being met.\n(2) LNG revenues exclude revenues from contracts with original expected durations of one year or less. As of December 31, 2023, Cheniere Marketing had short term delivery commitments of approximately 88 TBtu of LNG to be delivered to third party customers in 2024. Fixed fees are fees that are due to us regardless of whether a customer exercises, in certain instances, their contractual right to not take delivery of an LNG cargo under the contract. Variable fees are receivable only in connection with LNG cargoes that are delivered.\n(3) LNG revenues (variable fees) reflect the assumption of delivery of all contractual volumes, irrespective of any contractual right of non-delivery. LNG revenues (variable fees) are based on estimated forward prices and basis spreads as of December 31, 2023. The pricing structure of many of our SPA arrangements with our customers incorporates a variable fee per MMBtu of LNG generally equal to 115% of Henry Hub, which is paid upon delivery, thus limiting our net exposure to future increases in natural gas prices.\nThrough our SPAs and IPM agreements, we have contracted substantially all of the total anticipated production from the Liquefaction Projects through the mid-2030s. The majority of the contracted capacity is comprised of fixed-price, long-term SPAs that SPL and CCL have executed with third parties to sell LNG from the Liquefaction Projects. In addition, we market and sell LNG produced by the Liquefaction Projects that is not contracted by CCL or SPL through our integrated marketing function, Cheniere Marketing. Cheniere Marketing has a portfolio of long-, medium- and short-term SPAs to deliver commercial LNG cargoes to locations worldwide. These volumes are expected to be primarily sourced by LNG produced by the Liquefaction Projects but supplemented by volumes procured from other locations worldwide, as needed.\nSubstantially all of our contracted capacity is from contracts with terms exceeding 10 years. Excluding volumes from contracts with terms less than 10 years and volumes that are contractually subject to additional liquefaction capacity beyond what is currently in construction or operation, our SPAs and IPM agreements had approximately 16 years of weighted average remaining life as of December 31, 2023. Under the SPAs, the customers purchase LNG on either an FOB basis (delivered to the customer at the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal or the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal, as applicable) or a DAT basis (delivered to the customer at their specified LNG receiving terminal) generally for a price consisting of a fixed fee per MMBtu of LNG (a 41\nportion of which is subject to annual adjustment for inflation) plus a variable fee per MMBtu of LNG generally equal to 115% of Henry Hub. Certain customers may elect to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, with advance notice as governed by each respective SPA, in which case the customers would still be required to pay the fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes that are not delivered as a result of such cancellation or suspension. The variable fees under our SPAs were generally sized with the intention to cover the costs of gas purchases, transportation and liquefaction fuel consumed to produce the LNG to be sold under each such SPA. Our long-term SPA customers consist of creditworthy counterparties, with an average credit rating of A-, A3 and A- by S&P, Moody\u2019s and Fitch, respectively.

We record changes in the fair value of our derivative positions through earnings, based on the value for which the derivative instrument could be exchanged between willing parties. Valuation of our physical liquefaction supply derivative contracts is often developed through the use of internal models which includes significant unobservable inputs representing Level 3 fair value measurements as further described in of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants may use in valuing the asset or liability. To the extent valued using an option pricing model, we consider the future prices of energy units for unobservable periods to be a significant unobservable input to estimated net fair value. In estimating the future prices of energy units, we make judgments about market risk related to liquidity of commodity indices and volatility utilizing available market data. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments. We derive our volatility assumptions based on observed historical settled global LNG market pricing or accepted proxies for global LNG market pricing as well as settled domestic natural gas pricing. Such volatility assumptions also contemplate, as of the balance sheet date, observable forward curve data of such indices, as well as evolving available industry data and independent studies. In developing our volatility assumptions, we acknowledge that the global LNG industry is inherently influenced by events such as unplanned supply constraints, geopolitical incidents, unusual climate events including drought and uncommonly mild, by historical standards, winters and summers, and real or threatened disruptive operational impacts to global energy infrastructure. Our current estimate of volatility does not exclude the impact of otherwise rare events unless we believe market participants would exclude such events on account of their assertion that those events were specific to our company and deemed within our control.\nAs applicable to our natural gas supply contracts, our fair value estimates incorporate market participant-based assumptions pertaining to applicable contractual uncertainties, including those related to the availability of market information for delivery points, as well as the timing of both satisfaction of contractual events or states of affairs and delivery commencement. We may recognize changes in fair value through earnings that could be significant to our results of operations if and when such uncertainties are resolved.\nAdditionally, the valuation of certain physical liquefaction supply derivatives requires significant judgment in estimating underlying forward commodity curves due to periods of unobservability or limited liquidity. Such valuations are more susceptible to variability particularly when markets are volatile. Provided below are the changes in fair value from valuation of instruments valued through the use of internal models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions), which entirely consisted of physical liquefaction supply derivatives. The changes in fair value shown are limited to instruments still held at the end of each respective period.\nThe changes in fair value on instruments held at the end of both years are primarily attributed to a significant variance in the estimated and observable forward international LNG commodity prices on our IPM agreements during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe estimated fair value of level 3 derivatives recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 amounted to a liability of $2.2 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively, consisting entirely of physical liquefaction supply derivatives.\nThe ultimate fair value of our derivative instruments is uncertain, and we believe that it is reasonably possible that a material change in the estimated fair value could occur in the near future, particularly as it relates to commodity prices given the level of volatility in the current year.
