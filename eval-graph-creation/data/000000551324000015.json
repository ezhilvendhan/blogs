As a leading provider of employee benefits, we offer a broad portfolio of products and services through the workplace that provide support when it is needed most.\nSpecifically, we offer group, individual, voluntary, and dental and vision products as well as provide certain fee-based services. These products and services, which can be sold stand-alone or combined with other coverages, help employers of all sizes attract and retain the talented and capable workforce they need to succeed while protecting the incomes and livelihood of their employees. We believe employer-sponsored benefits are the most effective way to provide workers with access to information and options to protect their financial stability. Working people and their families, particularly those at lower and middle incomes, are perhaps the most vulnerable in today's economy yet are often overlooked by many providers of financial products and services. For many of these workers and families, employer-sponsored benefits are the primary defense against the potentially catastrophic financial impact of death, illness, or injury.\nWe have established a corporate culture consistent with the social value of our products and services. Because we see important links between the obligations we have to all of our stakeholders, we place a strong emphasis on operating with integrity and contributing to positive change in our communities. Accordingly, we are committed not only to meeting the needs of our customers who depend on us, but also to being accountable for our actions through sound and consistent business practices, a strong internal compliance program, a comprehensive risk management strategy, and an engaged employee workforce.\nWe believe our disciplined approach to providing financial protection products at the workplace puts us in a position of strength. The products and services we provide have never been more important to employers, employees, and their families. Our strategy remains centered on growing our core businesses through investing and transforming our operations and technology to anticipate and respond to the changing needs of the marketplace, driving enhanced customer experiences and expanding into new adjacent markets through meaningful partnerships and effective deployment of our capital across our portfolio.\nWe continue to analyze and employ strategies we believe will help us navigate the current environment and allow us to maintain financial flexibility to support the needs of our businesses while also allowing us to return capital to our shareholders. As we have seen in the current environment, we have substantial leverage to inflation and strong labor markets which generate wage and payroll growth. To the extent that our own costs increase as a result of wage inflation, we have the ability to adjust our prices on new and renewing business to reflect these higher costs.\nLong-term, we believe that consistent operating results, combined with the implementation of strategic initiatives and the effective deployment of capital, will allow us to meet our financial objectives.", "content": []}]}, {"title": "Reporting Segments", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "Our reporting segments are comprised of the following: Unum US, Unum International, Colonial Life, Closed Block, and Corporate.

Benefits are typically effective after 0 to 30 days for accidents and after 7 to 30 days for sickness.\nOur fee-based services include leave management and administrative services only (ASO) business. Leave management services provide administrative services on behalf of employers to ensure the protected leave eligibility and status for employees are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

These differences result from the use of mortality and morbidity tables and interest assumptions which we believe are more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and also result from differences in actuarial reserving methods.\nThe assumptions we use to calculate our liabilities are intended to represent an estimate of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. Some of the key assumptions include the discount rate, the claim resolution rate, the claim incidence rate, and policyholder lapse and mortality. There are also some key assumptions that are applicable only to certain product lines. Cash flow assumptions are reviewed and updated, as needed, at least annually. Assumptions may be updated more frequently, if necessary, based on trending experience and future expectations. On a quarterly basis, cohort level cash flow measures are updated based on the emergence of actual experience.\nThe change in the liability for future policy benefits, at the original discount rate, as of the beginning of the period, resulting from changes in cash flow assumptions and resulting from the emergence of actual experience from expected experience, is reflected as the 'policy benefits - remeasurement loss (gain)' in the consolidated statements of income. The impact of all other changes in the liability for future policy benefits are reflected as policy benefits in the consolidated statements of income.\nFor further discussion of our liabilities for future policy benefits, refer to \"Risk Factors\" contained herein in Item 1A, \"Critical Accounting Estimates\", and the discussion of segment operating results included in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 1 and 6 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.", "content": []}]}, {"title": "Investments", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "Investment activities are an integral part of our business, and profitability is significantly affected by investment results. We segment our invested assets into portfolios that support our various product lines. Generally, our investment strategy for our portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of our businesses and to manage interest rate risk. We seek to earn investment income while assuming risk in a prudent and selective manner, subject to the constraints of quality, liquidity, diversification, and regulatory considerations. Our overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of our insurance products. Assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities.\nWe may redistribute investments among our different lines of business or sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds, when necessary, to adjust the cash flow and/or duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability portfolios. Asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy. Cash flows from the in-force asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios. These results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates. Testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy, as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes. Although we test the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios as part of our modeling, the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive, and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk. Our determination of investment strategy relies on long-term measures such as reserve adequacy analysis and the relationship between the portfolio yields supporting our various product lines and the 12\naggregate discount rate assumptions embedded in the reserves. We also use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and the risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Issuer credit ratings reflect an agency's opinion of the overall financial capacity of a company to meet its senior debt obligations. Financial strength ratings are specific to each individual insurance subsidiary and reflect each rating agency's view of the overall financial strength (capital levels, earnings, growth, investments, business mix, operating performance, and market position) of the insuring entity and its ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Both the issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings incorporate quantitative and qualitative analyses by rating agencies and are routinely reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.\nRating agencies assign an outlook statement of \"positive,\" \"negative,\" or \"developing\" to indicate an intermediate-term trend in credit fundamentals which could lead to a rating change. \"Positive\" means that a rating may be raised, \"negative\" means that a rating may be lowered, and \"developing\" means that a rating may be raised or lowered with equal probability. Alternatively, a rating may have a \"stable\" outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change.\n\"Credit watch\" or \"under review\" highlights the potential direction of a short-term or long-term rating. It focuses on identifiable events and short-term trends that cause a rating to be placed under heightened surveillance by a rating agency. Events that may trigger this action include mergers, acquisitions, recapitalizations, regulatory actions, criteria changes, or operating developments. Ratings may be placed on credit watch or under review when an event or a change in an expected trend occurs and additional information is needed to evaluate the current rating level. This status does not mean that a rating change is inevitable, and ratings may change without first being placed on a watch list. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nSee \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Ratings\" contained herein in Item 7 for our current outlook, issuer credit, and financial strength ratings.

We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are quality of the customer experience regarding service and claims management, integrated product choices, enrollment capabilities, price, financial strength ratings, claims-paying ratings, and a solution to allow customers to comply with the changing laws and regulations related to family medical leave benefits.\nOur principal competitors for our products include the largest employee benefit insurance companies as well as regional companies offering specialty products. Some of these companies have more competitive pricing or have higher claims-paying ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete.\nIn the United Kingdom and Poland, where we sell both individual and group products, we compete with a mix of large internationally recognized providers and strong local carriers.\nAll areas of the employee benefits markets are highly competitive due to the yearly renewable term nature of certain of our products and the large number of insurance companies offering products in this market. As a result, there is a risk that our customers may seek coverage from competitors in lieu of renewing coverage with us. The effect of competition may, as a result, adversely affect the persistency of these and other products, as well as our ability to sell products in the future. 13\nWe must attract and retain independent agents and brokers to actively market our products.

State insurance regulators in the U.S. generally have broad powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business, including the power to: license and examine insurance companies; regulate and supervise sales practices and market conduct; license agents and brokers; approve policy forms; approve premium rates and subsequent increases thereon for certain insurance products; establish reserve requirements and solvency standards; place limitations on shareholder dividends; prescribe the form and content of required financial statements and reports; regulate the types and amounts of permitted investments; regulate the use and disclosure of personal information; and regulate reinsurance transactions. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are examined periodically by their states of domicile and by other states in which they are licensed to conduct business. The domestic examinations have traditionally emphasized financial matters from the perspective of protection of policyholders, but they can and have covered other subjects that an examining state may be interested in reviewing, such as market conduct issues and reserve adequacy. Examinations by non-domestic states more typically focus on market conduct, such as a review of sales practices, including the content and use of advertising materials and the licensing and appointing of agents and brokers, as well as underwriting, claims, and customer service practices, and identification and handling of unclaimed property to determine compliance with state laws. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessments by state insurance guaranty associations to cover the proportional cost of insolvent or failed insurers.\nWe are also regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) on a national basis, primarily for the protection of policyholders. The DOL enforces a comprehensive federal statute that regulates claims paying fiduciary responsibilities and reporting and disclosure requirements for most employee benefit plans.\nOur U.K. insurance subsidiary, Unum Limited, is subject to dual regulation by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The PRA oversees the financial health and stability of financial services firms and is responsible for the prudential regulation and day-to-day supervision of insurance companies. The FCA seeks to protect consumers and oversees the products and practices of financial services companies in the U.K., including insurance companies.\nIn 2020, an official bill was passed formalizing the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union (EU). A deal was reached later in 2020, on the future trading relationship with the EU, which focused primarily on the trading of goods rather than the U.K.\u2019s service sector. A memorandum of understanding on regulatory cooperation was announced in 2021 and signed by the U.K. and the EU in June 2023. The withdrawal did not have a material impact on our U.K. business. The U.K. government is reviewing the regulatory framework of financial services companies and the PRA is consulting with industry on proposed changes. Certain changes have already been finalized, which have improved the solvency position of our U.K. business at December 31, 2023. Additionally, the remaining pending proposals may lead to future changes in the solvency position of our U.K. business. Our Polish business, which is in the EU, was not impacted by the withdrawal.\nOur Polish insurance subsidiary, Unum Zycie TUiR, is subject to regulation by the Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego (KNF) of the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) in Poland.

The domiciliary states of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries have all adopted a version of the NAIC RBC Model Act, which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers. The basis of the system is a risk-based formula that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurer's business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer. The life and health RBC formula is designed to measure annually (i) the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations, (ii) the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience, (iii) the risk of loss from a mismatch in asset and liability cash flows due to changing interest rates, and (iv) business risks. The formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized. The formula is intended to be used as a regulatory tool only and is not intended as a means to rank insurers generally.\nThe NAIC continues to review the state-based solvency regulation framework to identify opportunities to respond to national and international insurance regulatory and solvency developments. The topics of its review include capital requirements, governance and risk management, statutory accounting and financial reporting, and reinsurance. This ongoing review has resulted in changes to U.S. insurance regulation and solvency standards, including those for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.\nAll states where our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require insurers to conduct, at least annually, an own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA), which is a group-level perspective on the risks of current and future business plans and the sufficiency of capital to support those risks. We file an ORSA summary report annually with the applicable insurance regulators.\nThe NAIC has also developed a group capital calculation (GCC) intended to be used by U.S. regulators as a tool to assess the risks and financial position of insurance groups, including any non-insurance subsidiaries. The NAIC amended the Model Holding Company Act and Regulation to adopt the GCC and implement an annual GCC filing requirement. O ur lead state regulator, the Maine Bureau of Insurance (MBOI), adopted the NAIC GCC standards in 2022 and we subsequently submitted our first GCC report to the MBOI in 2023. These standards have not had an impact on our capital management.\nWe are also monitoring the International Association of Insurance Supervisors' (IAIS) development of new capital requirements applicable to Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs). While we are not currently subject to the reforms adopted by the IAIS, they are a factor influencing the substance and timing of the NAIC's activities around capital.\nThe NAIC and state insurance regulators continue to examine the industry's use of captive insurance companies to transfer insurance risk and reserves required under current regulations. No changes in the use or regulation of captive reinsurers have been proposed by the NAIC, and we are unable to predict the extent of any changes that might be made. Fairwind remains our only captive reinsurer. We expect to continue our strategy of using a captive reinsurer to manage risks while monitoring the NAIC's study and proposed changes in regulations. See \"Reinsurance\" contained herein in this Item 1 for further discussion.\nThe PRA has statutory requirements, including capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and minimum solvency margins, to which Unum Limited must adhere as part of the provisions of Solvency II, an EU directive that is part of retained U.K. law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which prescribes capital requirements and risk management standards. Our U.K. holding company is also subject to the Solvency II requirements relevant to insurance holding companies, while its subsidiaries (the Unum UK Solvency II Group), which includes Unum Limited, are subject to group and individual supervision under Solvency II. The Unum UK Solvency II Group received approval from the U.K. PRA to use its own internal model for calculating regulatory capital and also received approval for certain associated regulatory permissions including transitional relief which applies until January 2032. The U.K. government is reviewing the regulatory framework of financial services companies and the PRA is consulting with the industry on proposed changes. Certain changes have already been finalized, which have improved the solvency position of our U.K. business at December 31, 2023. Additionally, the remaining pending proposals may lead to future changes in the solvency position of our U.K. business.

Transactions between an insurer and affiliates in the holding company system generally must be fair and reasonable and, if material, require prior notice and approval by the domiciliary state insurance regulator.\nIn addition, such laws and regulations restrict the amount of dividends that may be paid by our insurance subsidiaries to their respective shareholders, including our Company and certain of our intermediate holding company subsidiaries. See further discussion in \"Risk Factors\" contained herein in Item 1A and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Available from Subsidiaries\" contained herein in Item 7.\nThe NAIC has adopted the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act and the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Regulation, which require U.S. insurers to disclose detailed information regarding their governance practices. The model act and regulation must be adopted by individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective in a particular state. All of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled have adopted a requirement to file a corporate governance annual disclosure similar to the model act and regulation.\nThe laws of most states, including the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (or deemed to be commercially domiciled), require regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurance company or its holding company. Where these laws apply to us, there can be no effective change in control of our Company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement containing specified information with the appropriate insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval of the proposed change. The usual measure for a presumptive change of control pursuant to these laws is the acquisition of 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company, although this presumption is rebuttable. Consequently, a person acquiring 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company without the prior approval of the insurance regulators in the state(s) of domicile of the insurance company(ies) sought to be acquired (or whose holding company is sought to be acquired) will be in violation of these laws. Such a person may also be subject to one or more of the following actions: (i) injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those shares by the applicable insurance regulators; (ii) prohibition of voting of such shares; and (iii) other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulators. Further, many states' insurance laws require that prior notification be given to state insurance regulators of a change in control of a non-domiciled insurance company doing business in the state. These pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance regulators to disapprove the change in control; however, they do authorize regulatory action in the affected state if particular conditions exist, such as undue market concentration. Any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of our Company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries may require prior notification in those states that have adopted pre-notification laws.\nThese laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change in control of our Company, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable.", "content": []}]}, {"title": "Information Security and Privacy Regulation", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "A growing number of federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations require companies, including insurance companies, to adopt measures designed to protect the security and privacy of personal information collected during the course of operations.

Certain of our insurance products also are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which is enforced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and regulates the disclosure and use of protected health information. Generally, these laws require insurers to give policyholders notice about the insurer\u2019s privacy practices, place restrictions on how the insurer can use and disclose personal information, require the insurer to enact certain cybersecurity measures to protect the data, and obligate insurers to notify individuals and regulators in certain cases when personal data is compromised.\nCybersecurity is an area of significant, and increasing, focus of insurance regulators. For example, the NAIC's Insurance Data Security Model Law (the Cybersecurity Model Law), enacted in over twenty states, requires insurers to implement cybersecurity measures and develop cyber incident response plans. The New York State Department of Financial Services' cybersecurity regulation contains provisions similar to the Cybersecurity Model Law, in addition to more prescriptive cybersecurity obligations.\nStates are also adopting laws and regulations that govern the collection, processing, storage, and destruction of personal information outside the context of providing insurance products. Several states have enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws, and other states are considering passing similar laws. Currently, significant portions of our business are exempt from the requirements of these laws, but we cannot be certain that will continue to be the case as additional laws are adopted and existing laws are amended.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation of the EU and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (collectively referred to as \"the GDPR\") establish the legal framework for our EU and U.K. entities that collect and process information from individuals who reside in the EU and U.K., respectively.

In accordance with the rules and listing standards, each listed issuer must adopt and disclose a policy, known as a clawback policy, providing for the recovery of any erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation from current and former executive officers in the event of a required accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws. The clawback policy would apply to compensation received during the three-year period preceding the date the issuer is required to prepare the accounting restatement.

It imposed a new 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) on corporations that have average AFSI over $1.0 billion in any prior three-year period, starting with years 2020 to 2022. Our company is an applicable corporation, but we do not have a CAMT liability as of December 31, 2023. 17\nWe do not expect that any CAMT incurred in the future would impact earnings since it would be offset with a credit toward regular income tax in subsequent years. We continue to monitor the ongoing guidance issued by the United States Treasury. The IRA also imposed a one percent excise tax on the fair market value of corporate stock repurchases effective January 1, 2023.\nIn 2021, the Finance Act 2021 was enacted in the U.K., which established a U.K. corporate tax rate of 25 percent effective April 1, 2023.\nSee \"Executive Summary\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" contained herein in Item 7 and Notes 9 and 12 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for discussion of the impact to our financial position and results of operations as a result of these changes.\nFederal, foreign, and state tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such change could materially impact our federal, foreign, or state taxes and reduce profitability as well as capital levels in our insurance subsidiaries.

Several jurisdictions, including the U.K., Poland, and Ireland, have adopted or plan to adopt Pillar Two for tax years after 2023. Legislation enacted thus far as a result of Pillar Two is not expected to materially impact the Company. We continually monitor tax legislative and regulatory developments to understand their potential impact on our profitability.\nRegulatory focus on the risks posed by climate change is increasing, with some regulators now requiring that the Company integrate consideration of the risks of climate change into our governance and risk management frameworks, and other regulators attempting to limit the types of factors that can be incorporated into investment decisions.

Changes in societal attitudes, such as work ethic, motivation, or stability, can significantly affect the demand for and underwriting results from disability products.\nBoth economic and societal factors can affect claim incidence and recoveries for disability insurance. Claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by, among other factors, the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence. Claim incidence and claim recovery rates may also be influenced by the emergence of new infectious diseases or illnesses. Claim durations may be extended by medical improvements which could extend life expectancies. The relationship between these and other factors and overall incidence is very complex and will vary due to contract design features and the degree of expertise within the insuring organization to price, underwrite, and adjudicate the claims. 22\nWithin the group disability market, pricing and renewal actions can be taken in response to higher claim rates and higher administrative expenses. However, these actions take time to implement, and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices. In addition, changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time. The pricing actions available in the individual disability market differ among product classes. Our individual noncancelable disability policies, in which the policy is guaranteed to be renewable through the life of the policy at a fixed premium, do not permit us to adjust premiums on our in-force business.

Because long-term care insurance is a relatively new product for the insurance industry and is long-duration in nature, there is not as much historical data as is available for our other products, especially at advanced ages. This creates a level of uncertainty in properly pricing the product and using appropriate assumptions when establishing reserves. Long-term care insurance is guaranteed renewable and can be repriced to reflect adverse experience, but the repricing is subject to regulatory approval by our states of domicile and may also be subject to approval by jurisdictions in which our policyholders reside. The rate approval process can affect the length of time in which the repricing can be implemented, if at all, and the rate increases ultimately approved may be unfavorable relative to assumptions used to establish our reserves. We monitor our own experience and industry studies concerning morbidity, mortality, and policyholder terminations to understand emerging trends. Changes in actual experience relative to our expectations may adversely affect our profitability and reserves. To the extent mortality improves for the general population, and life expectancies increase, the period for which a claimant receives long-term care benefits may lengthen and the associated impact of advanced aging of policyholders may cause an increase in claims incidence.

VOBA is amortized based primarily upon expected future premium income of the related insurance policies. Recoverability testing for VOBA is performed on an annual basis. Insurance contracts are grouped on a basis consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring profitability of the contracts. If recoverability testing indicates that VOBA is not recoverable, the deficiency is charged to expense.

If the discount rate assumed in our pricing is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets may not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments.\nAnother interest, or discount, rate is used in calculating reserves. We set our GAAP reserve discount rate assumptions each period based on a yield that is reflective of an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument, which is generally equivalent to a single-A interest rate matched to the duration of our insurance liabilities. A decline in the single-A interest rate could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nWe are also required to perform annual statutory adequacy testing that considers multiple interest rate scenarios, to ensure our statutory reserves continue to meet statutory requirements, which could require us to increase our statutory reserves and/or contribute additional capital to our insurance subsidiaries.\nOur net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for our pension plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience.

In addition, if investment markets become illiquid or severely impaired, we may be unable to liquidate our investments in a timely and advantageous manner.\nFrom an operational perspective, our employees, sales associates, brokers, and distribution partners, as well as the workforces of our vendors, service providers, and counterparties, may be adversely affected by a pandemic or other public health issue, 27\nincluding government-mandated shutdowns, requests or orders for employees to work remotely, and other social distancing measures. These measures could result in an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business, including our ability to sell our policies and our ability to adjudicate and pay claims in a timely manner. Additionally, our hybrid work environment may expose us to various additional risks such as elevated cybersecurity vulnerability resulting from the wide-scale remote usage of our company networks and related risks to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nThere is no guarantee that processes we have developed in order to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic would succeed in allowing us to adapt to any future pandemic or other public health issue, which may have materially different characteristics than the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo the extent pandemics or other public health issues adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and overall business operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks disclosed herein in this Item 1A \"Risk Factors\".\nSee \"Executive Summary\", \"Segment Operating Results\", and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" included herein in Part 2, Item 7 under \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional discussion.", "content": []}, {"title": "General Risks", "text": "", "content": []}]}, {"title": "We and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation.

The primary purpose of insurance regulation is to protect policyholders, not stockholders. To that end, regulatory authorities, including state insurance departments in the United States, the PRA in the United Kingdom, and the KNF in Poland have broad administrative powers over many aspects of the insurance business, including requiring various licenses, permits, authorizations, or accreditations, which our insurance subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain, or may be able to do so only at great cost. In addition, we and our insurance subsidiaries may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and insurance holding companies. These laws and regulations can be complex and subject to differing interpretations and are regularly re-examined. Existing or future laws and regulations, and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. For example, they may restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us, restrict transactions between subsidiaries and/or between us and our subsidiaries, and may require contributions of capital by us to our insurance subsidiaries even if we are otherwise in compliance with stated requirements. Failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws or regulations could result in restrictions on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which they operate and could result in fines and other sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nRegulatory examinations or investigations could result in, among other things, an increase to reserving requirements, changes in our claims handling or other business practices, changes in procedures for the identification and payment to the states of benefits and other property that is not claimed by the owners, changes in the use and oversight of reinsurance, changes in governance and other oversight procedures, assessments by tax authorities or other governing agencies, fines, and other administrative action, which could injure our reputation, adversely affect our issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings, place us at a competitive disadvantage in marketing or administering our products, impair our ability to sell or retain insurance policies, and/or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIt is possible that there will be heightened oversight of insurers by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and operate. We cannot predict specific proposals that might be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. For instance, the NAIC or state regulators may adopt further revisions to statutory reserving standards or the RBC formula, the PRA may revise its capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins, the IAIS may adopt capital requirements to which we could be subject, or rating agencies may incorporate higher capital thresholds into their quantitative analyses, thus requiring additional capital contributions by us to our insurance subsidiaries. Increased financial services regulation, which could include activities undertaken by the NAIC and regulatory authorities in the U.K., Poland, and the EU may impose greater quantitative requirements, supervisory review, and disclosure requirements and may impact the business strategies, capital requirements, and profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. The U.K. government is reviewing the regulatory framework of 28\nfinancial services companies and the PRA is consulting with the industry on proposed changes. Certain changes have already been finalized, which have improved the solvency position of our U.K. business at December 31, 2023. Additionally, the remaining pending proposals may lead to future changes in the solvency position of our U.K. business. The U.K.'s Financial Ombudsman Service, which was established to help settle disputes between consumers and businesses providing financial services, and the FCA, which has rule-making, investigative, and enforcement powers to protect consumers, may hamper our ability to do business, which could have a material adverse effect on our U.K. operations.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies within these countries, which may also be influenced by the International Accounting Standards Board. Future accounting standards we adopt will change current accounting and disclosure requirements applicable to our financial statements. Such changes could have a material effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition and may impact the perception of our business by external stakeholders including the rating agencies that assign the issuer credit rating on Unum Group.\nWe use an affiliated captive reinsurer for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by one of our insurance subsidiaries in order to effectively manage risks in connection with certain blocks of our business as well as to enhance our capital efficiency. If we were required to discontinue use of the captive reinsurer or to alter the structure of the captive reinsurance arrangement, our ability to maintain current RBC ratios and/or our capital deployment activities could be adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. programs such as healthcare reform, the continued emergence of paid family and medical leave legislation, and financial services sector reform may compete with or diminish the need or demand for our products, particularly as it may affect our ability to sell our products through employers or in the workplace. The U.S. social security disability insurance program may not be sustainable, which may adversely affect the level of our disability claim payments and reserves. Legislative changes related to pension funding requirements could negatively impact our cash flows from operations and our profitability.\nChanges in tax laws and other regulations or interpretations of such laws or regulations could unfavorably impact our corporate taxes. In addition, changes in tax laws could make some of our products less attractive to consumers.\nChanges in privacy, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence laws and regulations may result in cost increases as a result of system implementations, administrative processes, effects of potential noncompliance, and limitations or constraints of our business models.\nChanges in laws governing oversight and management of climate change risk may subject us to increased costs.\nMost group long-term and short-term disability plans we administer are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Changes to ERISA enacted by Congress or through judicial interpretations may adversely affect the risk to us of managing employee benefit plans, increase the premiums associated with such plans, and ultimately affect their affordability and our profitability.\nThe insurance departments in jurisdictions wherein our insurance subsidiaries conduct business may limit our ability to obtain rate increases under guaranteed renewable contracts or could require changes in rates and/or benefits to meet minimum loss ratio requirements which could negatively impact the profitability of our products. Many regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees. These regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices are improper. These actions could result in substantial fines or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

A downgrade of our financial strength ratings may adversely affect us and could potentially, among other things, adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force, negatively impact persistency and new sales, and generally adversely affect our ability to compete. A downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to Unum Group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise additional capital.

Those who conduct business on our behalf, including executive officers and members of management, sales managers, investment professionals, and to some extent, independent agents and brokers, do so in part by making decisions that involve exposing us to risk. These include decisions such as maintaining effective underwriting and pricing discipline, maintaining effective claim management and customer service performance, managing our investment portfolio and derivatives trading activities, delivering effective technology solutions, complying with established sales practices, executing our capital management strategy, exiting a line of business and/or pursuing strategic growth initiatives, and other decisions.

The CORC is responsible for ensuring risks to our non-insurance operational functions, including those related to third-party vendors, are identified and managed within our risk appetite, and that our TPRM program and strategy align with our overall business objectives.\nThe CORC and the ISC both report risks to our Executive Risk Management Committee (ERMC), which is comprised of senior management from our corporate functions and business segments and is responsible for overseeing our enterprise-wide risk management program. The ERMC is chaired by the CRO, who maintains a direct line of communication with the Risk and Finance Committee (RFC) of our board of directors.\nThe RFC is the board committee that oversees our cybersecurity risk management. Our CISO makes quarterly reports to the RFC about material cybersecurity risks, updates to the cybersecurity program, metrics that evaluate the effectiveness of the cybersecurity program, material cybersecurity incidents and remediation plans. The RFC also receives timely reports from the CISO when there are significant cybersecurity incidents or updates to the cybersecurity risk assessment. The board of directors also takes an active role in overseeing cybersecurity risk, including receiving an annual report from the CISO that provides an overview of the status and effectiveness of our cybersecurity risk management program and participating in cybersecurity incident response tabletop exercises.\nSee \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" contained herein in Item 7A for further information.

See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\" contained herein in this Item 7 for a reconciliation of these items.\nOur Unum US segment reported income before income tax and net investment gains and losses of $1,484.3 million in 2023 compared to $1,143.4 million in 2022, which include the reserve assumption updates that occurred during the third quarters of 2023 and 2022. Excluding these items, our Unum US segment reported adjusted operating income of $1,355.5 million in 2023 compared to $972.6 million in 2022 , due to favorable benefits experience primarily in our group product lines and an increase in premium income, partially offset by higher operating expenses and lower net investment income. Th e benefit ratio, excluding the reserve assumption updates, for our Unum US segment for 2023 was 59.8 percent , compared to 66.3 percent in 2022.

Excluding these items, our Colonial Life segment reported adjusted operating income of $400.1 million in 2023 compared to $412.9 million in 2022, primarily due to higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs and operating expenses, partially offset by higher premium income and favorable benefit experience. The benefit ratio, excluding the reserve assumption updates, for Colonial Life was 50.9 percent in 2023 compared to 51.8 percent in 2022. Colonial Life sales increased 6.2 percent in 2023 compared to 2022.\nOur Closed Block segment reported a loss before income tax and net investment gains and losses of $282.8 million in 2023 compared to income before income tax and net investment gains and losses of $176.9 million in 2022, which include the amortization of the cost of reinsurance and the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction, as well as the reserve assumption updates. Excluding these items, our Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of $164.9 million in 2023 compared to $251.9 million in 2022. The net premium ratio for long-term care increased to 93.5 percent at December 31, 2023 from 85.1 percent at December 31, 2022. The interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care, excluding reserve assumption updates, was unfavorable during 2023 compared to 2022.\nA rising interest rate environment could positively impact our yields on new investments, but could also create unrealized losses in our current holdings. Alternatively, a declining interest rate environment could negatively impact our yields on new investments, but could also reduce unrealized losses in our current holdings. As of December 31, 2023, we do not hold any securities with a decline in fair value below amortized cost which we intend to sell nor any securities for which it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in amortized cost. The net unrealized loss on our fixed maturity securities was $1.6 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, with the decrease due primarily to a decrease in corporate bond spreads and to a lesser extent the portfolio repositioning that we executed in the third quarter of 2023. The earned book yield on our investment portfolio decreased to 4.45 percent for 2023 compared to a yield of 4.57 percent for 2022.\nAdditionally, a rising interest rate environment could result in reserve decreases while a declining interest rate environment could result in reserve increases, specific to our liability for future policy benefits, as the reserve discount rate assumptions used in the calculation of our liability are updated at each reporting date using a yield that is reflective of an upper-medium grade fixed income instrument, which is generally equivalent to a single-A interest rate matched to the duration of certain of our insurance liabilities. The change in discount rate assumptions on the liability for future policy benefits, net of reinsurance, due primarily to the decrease in credit spreads during 2023, resulted in an increase to the liability for future policy benefits, net of reinsurance, of approximately $1.2 billion.\nWe believe our capital and financial positions are strong. At December 31, 2023, the RBC ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, calculated on a weighted average basis using the NAIC Company Action Level formula, was approximately 415 percent, which is in line with our expectations. We repurchased 5.7 million shares of Unum Group common stock under our share repurchase program, at a cost of approximately $252 million, including commissions and excise tax, during 2023. In December 2023, we retired 115.0 million shares of our treasury stock with a total cost of $3,642.5 million. Our weighted average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution, equaled 197.6 million and 202.1 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively.

A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measure of \"after-tax adjusted operating income\" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of investment gains or losses, the amortization of the cost of reinsurance, the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance, and reserve assumption updates as well as certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below. Investment gains or losses primarily include realized investment gains or losses, expected investment credit losses, and gains or losses on derivatives. We believe after-tax adjusted operating income is a better performance measure and better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.\nInvestment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of investment gains or losses. Although we may experience investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities.\nCash flow assumptions used to calculate our liability for future policy benefits are reviewed at least annually and updated, as needed, with the resulting impact reflected in net income. While the effects of these assumption updates are recorded in the 42\nreporting period in which the review is completed, these updates reflect experience emergence and changes to expectations spanning multiple periods. We believe that by excluding the impact of reserve assumption updates we are providing a more comparable and consistent view of our quarterly results.\nWe exited a substantial portion of our Closed Block individual disability product line through the two phases of the reinsurance transaction that were executed in December 2020 and March 2021. As a result, we exclude the amortization of the cost of reinsurance that we recognized upon the exit of the business related to the policies on claim status as well as the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance that resulted from the adoption of ASU 2018-12. Due to the execution of the second phase of the reinsurance transaction occurring after January 1, 2021, the transition date of ASU 2018-12, in accordance with the provisions of the ASU related to non-contemporaneous reinsurance, we were required to establish the ceded reserves using an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument as of the reinsurance transaction date in March 2021 which resulted in higher ceded reserves compared to that which was reported historically. However, the direct reserves for the block reinsured in the second phase were calculated using the original discount rate utilized as of the transition date. Both the direct and ceded reserves are then remeasured at each reporting period using a current discount rate reflective of an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument, with the changes recognized in OCI. While the total equity impact is neutral, the different original discount rates utilized for direct and ceded reserves result in disproportionate earnings impacts. The impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance will fluctuate depending on the magnitude of reserve changes during the period. We believe that the exclusion of these items provides a better view of our results from our ongoing businesses.\nWe may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.\nSee \"Executive Summary\" contained herein in Item 7 and Notes 3, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, and 17 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion regarding the items specified in the reconciliations below.\nA reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to our non-GAAP financial measures is as follows:\nWe measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of \"adjusted operating revenue\" and \"adjusted operating income\" or \"adjusted operating loss,\" which differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of investment gains and losses, the amortization of the cost of reinsurance, the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance, reserve assumption updates, as well as certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue, income before income tax, net income, or net loss.\nA reconciliation of total revenue to \"adjusted operating revenue\" and income before income tax to \"adjusted operating income\" is as follows:", "content": []}]}]}]}, {"title": "Critical Accounting Estimates", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

Liability for future policy benefits includes policy liabilities for claims not yet incurred and for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us. Liability for future policy benefits equaled $40.0 billion and $38.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, or approximately 74.6 percent and 73.6 percent of our total liabilities, respectively. Liability for future policy benefits ceded to reinsurers was $7.8 billion and $8.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported as a reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets.\nLiabilities for future policy benefits are initially established in the same period in which we issue a policy, and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and projected future premiums, allowing a margin for expenses and profit. The liabilities for future policy benefits build up and release over time, based on the emergence of cash flows, including premiums received and claims paid, and updated expectations for future cash flows.\nLiabilities for future policy benefits are updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in the liability based on policy development over time, emerging experience, and any assumption updates required to maintain the best estimate basis for expected future cash flows as required by GAAP. These future policy benefit liabilities are based on actual known facts regarding the liability, such as the benefits available under the applicable policy, the covered benefit period, the age, and, as appropriate, the occupation and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration, claim administration expenses, discount rate, policy benefit offsets, including those for social security and other government-based welfare benefits. The liability for future policy benefits also includes the liabilities for incurred claims.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities primarily relate to our traditional long-duration products which include our group, individual disability and certain of our voluntary benefits products in our Unum US segment; group, individual disability and life products in our Unum International segment; certain of our voluntary benefits products in our Colonial Life segment; and long-term care and certain of our other products in our Closed Block segment.\nIn calculating the liability for future policy benefits, our long-duration contracts are grouped into cohorts by product type and contract issue year. Liabilities for future policy benefits for claims not yet incurred are generally determined using the net premium model as prescribed by GAAP. At each reporting period, the liability for future policy benefits is remeasured at the current discount rate with the change recorded in other comprehensive income.\nThe calculation of the liability for future policy benefits involves numerous assumptions including discount rate, lapses, mortality, and morbidity. Certain product lines may utilize additional assumptions in calculating the liability for future policy benefits in addition to those listed above such as premium rate increases for long-term care, benefit offsets for Unum US long-term disability, claim costs for Unum US voluntary benefits and Colonial Life, and inflation-linked benefits for Unum UK group disability and group life. Claim costs capture the combined effect of the incidence rate, the expected level of benefit to be paid, and the claim resolution rate. Cash flow assumptions are reviewed and updated, as needed, at least annually. Assumptions may be updated more frequently, if necessary, based on trending experience.\nOn a quarterly basis, cohort level cash flow measures are updated based on the emergence of actual experience. The updated cash flows, based on experience emergence and any assumption updates, are used to determine the updated net premiums, the portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses, excluding acquisition costs or any costs that are required to be charged to expense as incurred. The updated net premium ratio is used to calculate the updated liability for 46\nfuture policy benefits as of the beginning of year, at the original discount rate. To the extent the present value of future benefits and expenses exceeds the present value of future gross premiums, an immediate charge is recognized in net income, such that net premiums are set equal to gross premiums. Future policy benefit liabilities are floored at zero at the cohort level in situations where the liabilities for future policy benefits are less than zero. The change in the liability for future policy benefits, at the original discount rate, as of the beginning of the period, resulting from cash flow changes is reflected as the change in benefits - remeasurement gain or loss in the consolidated statements of income. The impact of all other changes in the liability for future policy benefits are reflected as policy benefits in the consolidated statements of income.", "content": []}, {"title": "Key Assumptions", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "The calculation of the liability for future policy benefits involves numerous assumptions, but the primary assumptions used to calculate the liability are (1) the discount rate, (2) the claim resolution rate, (3) the claim incidence rate, and (4) policyholder lapse and mortality:\n1. The discount rate , which is used in calculating the liability for future policy benefits, is the interest rate that we use to discount future cash flows including premium and claim payments to determine the present value. A higher discount rate produces a lower reserve. If the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments. The original discount rates are initially set at the transition date of ASU 2018-12, which was January 1, 2021, for policies originally issued on or before the transition date, or at the policy issuance date, for policies issued after the transition date. For policies issued after the transition date, the original discount rate assumptions reflect an upper-medium grade (low-credit risk) fixed-income instrument yield based on the currency in which the liabilities are assumed. For all cohorts, the liability is then remeasured at each reporting period using the current discount rate reflective of an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument. We primarily utilize a forward curve which is derived from the underlying spot curve using interpolation to develop an ultimate forward rate.\n2. The claim resolution rate is the probability that a disability or long-term care claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured and it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim. Estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in liabilities that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time. Claim resolution assumptions involve many factors, including the cause of disability, the policyholder's age, the type of contractual benefits provided, and the time since initial disability. We primarily use our own claim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions. These assumptions are established for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability. Our studies incorporate actual claim resolution experience over a number of years and consider any observed trends over the study period. We also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience.\n3. The incidence rate is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us. The incidence rate is affected by many factors, including the age of the insured, the insured's occupation or industry, the benefit plan design, and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment. We establish our incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations.\n4. Policyholder lapse and mortality assumption s reflect the probability that insureds\u2019 coverage is discontinued due to lapsation or death of the insured. For our life insurance products, mortality assumptions also reflect the probability that a benefit payment occurs. These rates are affected by many factors, including the age of the insured, the insured's occupation or industry, the benefit plan design, and the length of time from policy or certificate issue to valuation date. We establish our mortality and lapse assumptions using a historical review of actual results along with an outlook of future expectations.\nEstablishing liability for future policy benefit assumptions is complex and involves many factors. Liabilities for future policy benefits, particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for long-term disabilities and long-term care, are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion. The impact of internal and external events, such as changes in claims operational procedures, economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence, the emergence of new diseases, new trends and developments in medical treatments, and legal trends and legislative changes, including changes to social security and other government-based welfare benefits programs which provide policy benefit offsets, among other factors, will influence claim incidence rates, claim resolution rates, and claim costs. In addition, for policies offering coverage for disability or long-term care at advanced ages, the level and pattern of mortality rates at advanced ages will impact overall benefit costs. Reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line. Additionally, in any period and over time, our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our long- 47\nterm assumptions, either singularly or collectively, and these variances may offset each other. We review our assumptions at least annually with a long-term view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time. Based on this review, we update our assumptions to reflect our current best estimates. Therefore, while it is possible to evaluate the sensitivity of overall results in our liability for future policy benefits based upon a change in each individual assumption, the actual impacts of changes to a variety of underlying assumptions must be considered in the aggregate by product line in order to judge the overall potential implications to the liability for future policy benefits. The following sections present the impacts of our most recent cash flow assumption reviews and an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in our assumptions, in aggregate, for the liabilities for future policy benefits which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved for, either favorable or unfavorable.", "content": []}]}, {"title": "Cash Flow Assumption Review", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "Our cash flow assumption reviews during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 resulted in the following impacts to income before income tax as a result of updating certain assumptions related to the liability for future policy benefits:", "content": []}, {"title": "2023 Significant Cash Flow Assumption Updates:", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "The cash flow assumption updates in our Unum US group long-term disability product line reduced our liability for future policy benefits by $121.0 million, due primarily to sustained improvement in claim recovery trends since our last assumption update.\nThe cash flow assumption updates in our Colonial Life segment reduced our liability for future policy benefits by $80.7 million, due primarily to improvement in certain of our claim cost assumptions and increased policyholder lapse rates since our last assumption update.\nThe cash flow assumption updates in our Closed Block segment were primarily driven by the long-term care product line which increased our liability for future policy benefits by $368.1 million, due primarily to lower expectations for active policy lapse and mortality assumptions, partially offset by an increase to expected future premium rate increases.", "content": []}, {"title": "2022 Significant Cash Flow Assumption Updates:", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "The cash flow assumption updates in our Unum US group long-term disability product line and our waiver of premium benefits for our Unum US group life product line reduced our liability for future policy benefits by $121.0 million and $34.0 million, respectively, due primarily to sustained improvement in claim recovery trends since our last assumption update, partially offset by lower social security benefit offsets for our group long-term disability product line.\nThe cash flow assumption updates in our Colonial Life segment reduced our liability for future policy benefits by $55.2 million, due primarily to improvement in certain of our claim cost assumptions since our most recent assumption update.\nThe cash flow assumption updates in our Closed Block segment were primarily driven by the all other product line.

The discount rate assumption for new cohorts, after the transition date, is based on the interest rate of an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument for that cohort period.\nOur claim resolution rate assumption used in determining the liability for future policy benefits is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period, both favorably and unfavorably. Claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period of time than our other reserve assumptions.

This sensitivity analysis is completed at least annually and was last completed as of December 31, 2023 for our product lines with a higher level of estimation uncertainty and utilizes the liability for future policy benefits valued at the original discount rate. See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" contained herein in Item 3 for information regarding the sensitivity of the current discount rate used to remeasure the liability for future policy benefits at each reporting date.\nIn our estimation, scenarios based on certain variations in each of our assumptions for our Unum US group long-term disability product line could produce a change of approximately $100 million which represents 1.9 percent of our Unum US group disability liability for future policy benefits balance. Of the assumptions impacting the estimated change in the liability for future policy benefits, the largest contributor is the claim resolution rate for which we assumed a change of approximately 10 percent.\nIn our estimation, scenarios based on certain possible variations in each of our assumptions for our Colonial Life segment could produce a change of approximately $60 million which represents 3.0 percent of our Colonial Life liability for future policy benefits balance. Of the assumptions impacting the estimated change in the liability for future policy benefits, the largest contributor is the claim costs, for which we assumed a change of approximately 10 percent.\nWe also consider variability in our assumptions related to the long-term care liability for future policy benefits. In our estimation, scenarios based on certain variations in each of our assumptions could produce potential results as illustrated in the chart below. The liability for future policy benefits for long-term care is based upon a number of key assumptions, and each assumption has various factors which may impact the long-term outcome. Key assumptions with respect to active policy lapses and mortality, claim incidence and resolutions, and future premium rate increases must incorporate extended views of expectations for many years into the future. The liability for future policy benefits is highly sensitive to these estimates. Key assumptions and related impacts are also heavily interrelated in both their outcome and in their effects on the liability for future policy benefits. For example, changes in the view of morbidity and mortality might be mitigated by either potential future premium rate increases and/or morbidity improvements due to general improvement in health and/or medical breakthroughs. There is a potentially wide range of outcomes for each assumption and in totality. As a result, and given the size of the long-term care liability for future policy benefits in relation to the total liability for future policy benefits, our sensitivity analysis for long-term care reflects the potential impact to the present value of gross liability cash flows for future policy benefits for updates to our key assumptions. The sensitivity analysis related to our key assumptions for the long-term care liability for future policy benefits is as shown below. The impact of changes to these assumptions would partially be reflected in the period in which the assumptions are updated and partially across future periods. Given the significant changes in certain assumptions, the below sensitivity analysis was completed as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2023 at which point the most recent assumption update review occurred.\nThe impact to current period liability for future benefits would be smaller in magnitude than the present value of gross liability for future policy benefits cash flows due to the updating of the net premium ratio. The current period liability for future policy benefits impact may be asymmetrical (i.e. larger for the unfavorable scenario) for some sensitivities if the assumption update causes the net premium ratio to be capped at 100 percent for any given cohort.\nWe believe that these sensitivities provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in liability for future policy benefit balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions, in the aggregate, could result in a material impact on our liability for future policy benefit levels, but we record our liability for future policy benefits based on our long-term best estimate for our cohorts and these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually to reflect the current best estimates. Product lines that have long-term claim payout periods have a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs, either positive or negative. We closely monitor emerging experience and use these results to inform our view of long-term assumptions. 50", "content": []}, {"title": "Fair Value of Investments", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "All of our fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, and all of our unrestricted equity securities are reported at fair value. Our derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. We report our investments in private equity partnerships at our share of the partnerships' net asset value or its equivalent (NAV), as a practical expedient for fair value.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and therefore represents an exit price, not an entry price. The exit price objective applies regardless of our intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date. We generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, and to a lesser extent, the income approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities and the income approach converts future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present value amount, or a discounted amount. We believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach, considering the types of investments we hold.\nThe degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value. The market sources from which we obtain or derive the fair values of our assets and liabilities carried at market value include quoted market prices for actual trades, price quotes from third party pricing vendors, price quotes we obtain from outside brokers, discounted cash flow, and observable prices for similar publicly traded or privately traded issues that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer. Our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs.\nInputs to valuation techniques refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, for example, the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value and/or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. We use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our financial instruments. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, and reflect our evaluation of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nCertain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices and/or observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity. For these securities, we use internally prepared valuations, including valuations based on estimates of future profitability, to estimate the fair value. Additionally, we may obtain prices from independent third-party brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities. Key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk-free interest rates, risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any), and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active market.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 11.6 percent of our fixed maturity securities were categorized as Level 1, 88 percent as Level 2, and 0.4 percent as Level 3. Level 1 is the highest category of the three-level fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Level 2 category includes assets or liabilities valued using inputs (other than those included in the Level 1 category) that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life. The Level 3 category is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value.\nRapidly changing credit and equity market conditions can materially impact the valuation of securities, and the period to period changes in value can vary significantly.\nSee \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" for information regarding the sensitivity of the estimated fair value for fixed maturity securities contained herein in Item 7A.

In determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security represents a credit loss, we evaluate the following factors:\n\u2022 Whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security \u2022 Whether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis \u2022 Whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments \u2022 The significance of the decline in value \u2022 Current and future business prospects and trends of earnings \u2022 The valuation of the security\u2019s underlying collateral \u2022 Relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles \u2022 Market conditions \u2022 Rating agency and governmental actions \u2022 Bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity \u2022 Adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments \u2022 Changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date \u2022 Any other key measures for the related security\nWe evaluate available information, including the factors noted above, both positive and negative, in reaching our conclusions. In particular, we also consider the strength of the issuer\u2019s balance sheet, its debt obligations and near term funding requirements, cash flow and liquidity, the profitability of its core businesses, the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity, its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment, and its access to capital markets. Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security, whether we intend to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether a credit loss is possible. The significance of the decline in value is also an important factor, but we generally do not record a credit loss based solely on this factor, since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security.\nWhile determining whether a credit loss exists is a judgmental area, we utilize a formal, well-defined, and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio, supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period. The process results in a thorough evaluation of investments and the recording of credit losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have credit loss.\nWe use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation. We estimate an allowance for credit losses that we expect to incur over the life of our mortgage loans using a probability of default method. For each loan, we estimate the probability that the loan will default before its maturity (probability of default) and the amount of the loss if the loan defaults (loss given default). These two factors result in an expected loss percentage that is applied to the amortized cost of each loan to determine the expected credit loss. Mortgage loans are reported at amortized cost less the allowance for expected credit losses with the change in expected credit losses recognized as an investment gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income.\nThere are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our investments for credit losses and determining when and if a credit loss exists. These risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities:\n\u2022 The assessment of a borrower's ability to meet its contractual obligations will change. \u2022 The economic outlook, either domestic or foreign, may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated, and as such, the investment may not recover in value. \u2022 New information may become available concerning the security, such as disclosure of accounting irregularities, fraud, or corporate governance issues. \u2022 Significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry. \u2022 Significant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchased. \u2022 Adverse rating agency actions may occur.\nSee Notes 1 and 3 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8. 52", "content": []}]}, {"title": "Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "We sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans for our employees, including non-qualified pension plans.

We also use, as applicable, expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits, which reflects a health care cost trend rate, and the U.K. plan also uses expected cost of living increases to plan benefits.\nThe assumptions chosen for our pension and OPEB plans are reviewed annually, using a December 31 measurement date for each of our plans unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement. The discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, and mortality rate assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans. In addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions, the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and OPEB plans may change due to factors such as plan amendments, actual experience being different from our assumptions, special benefits to terminated employees, and/or changes in benefits provided under the plans.\n\u2022 Discount rate - This interest assumption is based on the yield derived from a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments that reasonably match the timing and amounts of projected future benefits for each of our retirement-related benefit plans.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining valuation allowances. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We consider our investment strategies when evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets on unrealized losses on investments. In the event we determine that we more likely than not will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance is recorded in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance is reversed.\nIn establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions are made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. GAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The evaluation of a tax position is a two step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is to measure a position that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. If a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the amount initially measured, the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effective.\nChanges in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on our provision for income tax and our effective tax rate, which could significantly affect the amounts reported in our financial statements.\nSee \"Regulation\" contained herein in Item 1.

In periods when the pound weakens relative to the preceding period, translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period. In periods when the pound strengthens, translating pounds into dollars increases current period results relative to the prior period.\nThe weighted average pound/dollar exchange rate for our Unum UK line of business was 1.243, 1.221, and 1.378 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. If the 2022 and 2021 results for our U.K. operations had been translated at the 2023 weighted average exchange rate, our adjusted operating revenue would have been approximately $5 million higher and $73 million lower in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, our adjusted operating income would have been approximately $2 million higher and $10 million lower in 2022 and 2021, respectively. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert pounds into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the U.K.\nWe reported year-over-year premium growth in 2023 and 2022 in each of our principal operating business segments, primarily due to in-force block growth and higher overall sales. Premium income continues to decline, as expected, in our Closed Block segment.\nNet investment income was lower in 2023, relative to 2022, due to lower miscellaneous investment income, primarily related to smaller increases in the NAV on our private equity partnerships, and lower investment income from inflation index-linked bonds held by Unum UK, partially offset by a higher level of invested assets and an increased yield on invested assets. Net investment income was lower in 2022, relative to 2021, due to lower miscellaneous investment income and a decline in the 56\nyield on invested assets, partially offset by higher investment income from inflation index-linked bonds held by Unum UK and a higher level of invested assets.\nCredit losses on fixed maturity securities of $2.2 million were recognized in net investment gains and losses in 2023 compared to $4.6 million and $9.3 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the third quarter of 2023, we sold over $700 million of shorter duration bonds in our long-term care portfolio and reinvested the proceeds in higher quality, higher yielding, and longer duration bonds that better match our liability cash flows. We realized approximately $35 million of investment losses as a result of these sales. Also included in net investment gains and losses were changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement, which resulted in gains of $12.4 million, $16.2 million, and $9.7 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The changes in the embedded derivative are primarily driven by movements in credit spreads in the overall investment market. Included in the net investment gains and losses in 2021 was a net realized investment gain of $67.6 million related to the transfer of investments in the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction. See Notes 3 and 4 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.\nOther income is primarily comprised of fee-based service products in the Unum US segment, which include leave management services and administrative services only business, and the underlying results and associated net investment income of certain assumed blocks of reinsured business in the Closed Block segment.\nOverall benefits experience was favorable in 2023 relative to 2022 and 2021 with a consolidated benefit ratio of 72.2 percent in 2023, compared to 72.7 percent and 79.7 percent in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Excluding the impacts of the reserve assumption updates and non-contemporaneous reinsurance, the consolidated benefit ratios were 70.1 percent, 74.9 percent, and 81.9 percent in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. For further discussion on the reserve assumption updates and non-contemporaneous reinsurance, see the \"Executive Summary\" contained herein in this Item 7 and Notes 1, 6 and 15 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8. The underlying benefits experience for each of our operating business segments is discussed more fully in \"Segment Results\" contained herein in this Item 7.\nCommissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher in 2023 compared to 2022 driven primarily by higher overall sales and in-force block growth in our principal operating segments. The increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2023 compared to 2022 is due primarily to increased growth in the level of the deferred asset and the impact of policyholder lapses in our Colonial Life segment and in our Unum US supplemental and voluntary product lines. Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher in 2022 compared to 2021 driven primarily by higher sales in our Colonial Life segment and Unum US supplemental and voluntary product line. Also contributing to the year-over-year growth in commissions during 2022 was in-force block growth and favorable persistency in our Unum US group disability product line. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs was lower in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to a decrease in the average amortization period in our Unum US group disability and group life and accidental death and dismemberment product lines that occurred in 2021, partially offset by higher policyholder lapses in our Colonial Life accident, sickness, and disability product line.\nIn 2022, cost related to early retirement of debt includes costs associated with the redemption of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.000% senior notes due 2024 and costs related to the retirement of $14.0 million aggregate liquidation amount of the 7.405% capital securities due 2038 issued by Provident Financing Trust I (the Trust), which resulted in the reduction of a corresponding principal amount of our 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038 then held by the Trust. In 2021, cost related to early retirement of debt includes costs associated with the purchase and retirement of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.500% senior notes due 2025. See Note 10 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further information.\nWe reported year-over-year increases in other expenses and compensation expense, on a combined basis, in both 2023 and 2022 due primarily to increases in employee-related costs, operational investments in our business, and growth in our fee-based service products, partially offset by a reduction in the amortization of the cost of reinsurance.\nOur effective income tax rate for 2023 was 21.7 percent, compared to 19.6 percent in 2022 and 22.2 percent in 2021. Our 2023 effective tax rate was generally consistent with the U.S. statutory rate. Our 2022 effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate due to the foreign tax rate differential. Our 2021 effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate due to unfavorable impacts of the U.K. tax rate increase enacted in 2021.

As a result of the execution of the second phase of the reinsurance transaction occurring after January 1, 2021, the transition date of ASU 2018-12, in accordance with the provisions of the ASU related to non-contemporaneous reinsurance, we were required to establish the ceded reserves using an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument as of the reinsurance transaction date in March 2021 which resulted in higher ceded reserves compared to that which was reported historically. However, the direct reserves for the block reinsured in the second phase were calculated using the original discount rate utilized as of the transition date.

In states for which a rate increase is submitted and approved, we routinely provide customers options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needs. Despite continued anticipated premium rate increases in our long-term care business, we expect overall premium income and adjusted operating revenue to decline over the long term as these closed blocks of business wind down.

Claim resolution rates which reflect the probability that a disability or long-term care claim will close due to recovery or death of the insureds, are very sensitive to operational and external factors and can be volatile. Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period. It is possible that variability in any of our reserve assumptions, including, but not limited to, mortality, morbidity, resolutions, premium rate increases, benefit change elections, and persistency, could result in a material impact to our reserves.\nAs a result of the execution of the reinsurance transaction related to our Closed Block individual disability line of business, we have fully ceded a significant portion of this business.

The security is a utilities company and had a fair value of $27.3 million and a gross unrealized loss of $18.1 million.\nUnrealized losses on investment-grade fixed maturity securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in market or sector credit spreads which occurred subsequent to the acquisition of the securities. Below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities are generally more likely to develop credit concerns than investment-grade securities. At December 31, 2023, the unrealized losses in our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities were generally due to higher interest rates, wider credit spreads in certain industries or sectors and, to a lesser extent, credit concerns related to specific securities.

The MBOI granted permission to Unum America on May 1, 2020, to phase in the additional statutory reserves over seven years beginning with year-end 2020 and ending with year-end 2026. The calculation of the premium deficiency reserve (PDR) reflects specific assumptions set by MBOI and results in significant margin above Unum America\u2019s best estimate assumptions. As of December 31, 2023, the PDR calculated under the basis resulting from the MBOI examination has been fully recognized. The phase in amounts for 2023, 2022, and 2021 were funded using cash flows from operations and capital contributions from Unum Group. Our long-term care reserves and financial results reported under generally accepted accounting principles were not affected by the MBOI\u2019s examination conclusion. Additional information regarding the Unum America PDR is as follows:\nUnum America cedes blocks of long-term care business to Fairwind Insurance Company (Fairwind), which is an affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiary domiciled in the United States. The ability of Fairwind to pay dividends to Unum Group will depend on its satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured by Fairwind. Fairwind did not pay dividends in 2023. During 2023, Unum Group made $600.0 million in capital contributions to Fairwind. We do not expect to make capital contributions to Fairwind during 2024.\nThe ability of Unum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries also depends on additional factors such as RBC ratios and capital adequacy and/or solvency requirements, funding growth objectives at an affiliate level, and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings. The RBC ratios for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2023 are in line with our expectations and are significantly above the level that would require state regulatory action.\nUnum Group and/or certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries may also receive dividends from our U.K. subsidiaries, the payment of which may be subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance in the U.K. Unum Limited is subject to the requirements of Solvency II, a European Union (EU) directive that is part of retained UK law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which prescribes capital requirements and risk management standards for the European insurance industry. Our U.K. holding company is also subject to the Solvency II requirements relevant to insurance holding companies while, together with certain of its subsidiaries including Unum Limited, the group (the Unum UK Solvency II Group) is subject to group supervision under Solvency II. The Unum UK Solvency II Group received approval from the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) to use its own internal model for calculating regulatory capital and also received approval for certain associated regulatory permissions including transitional relief as the Solvency II capital regime continues to be implemented. In connection with the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU, the U.K. government is reviewing the regulatory framework of financial services companies and the PRA is consulting with industry on proposed changes. Certain changes have already been finalized, which have improved the solvency position of our U.K. business at December 31, 2023. Additionally, the remaining pending proposals may lead to future changes in the solvency position of our U.K. business.\nThe payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiary's board of directors.\nThe amount available during 2023 for the payment of ordinary dividends from Unum Group's traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which excludes Fairwind, was approximately $991 million. During 2023, we declared and paid in cash $1,440.6 million in dividends, of which $655.0 million was considered an extraordinary dividend. During 2023, Unum Limited declared and paid dividends of \u00a365.0 million to Unum Group through our U.K holding company, Unum European Holding Company Limited.\nDuring 2024, we intend to maintain a level of capital in our insurance subsidiaries above the applicable capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins. As a result of our consideration of overall capitalization needs, we may not utilize the entire amount of dividends available in 2024, which are based on applicable restrictions under current law. Approximately $1,289 million is available, without prior approval by regulatory authorities, during 2024 for the payment of dividends from Unum Group's traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which excludes our captive reinsurer. Approximately \u00a3140 million is available to be distributable from Unum Limited during 2024. The actual amount distributable during 2024 will depend on experience, including the impact of market movements, and is subject to local requirements, as well as regulatory and other business considerations.\nInsurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from non-insurance subsidiaries except where the non-insurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by Unum Group, which does not apply to our current entity structure.", "content": [{"title": "Funding for Employee Benefit Plans", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we made contributions of $74.0 million and \u00a34.6 million to our U.S. and U.K. defined contribution plans, respectively, and expect to make contributions of approximately $78 million and \u00a35 million during 2024.

We also maintain reinsurance agreements for which the recoverable under those agreements totaled $13,092.3 million of which $1,358.3 million is estimated to offset related policyholder liability payments in 2024. Policyholder liabilities and the related reinsurance recoverable represent the projected payout of the current in-force policyholder liabilities and the expected cash inflows from reinsurers for liabilities ceded and therefore incorporate uncertainties as to the timing and amount of claim payments. We utilize extensive liability modeling to project future cash flows from the in-force business. The primary assumptions used to project future cash flows are discount rate, claim resolution rate, incidence rate, and policyholder lapse and mortality. These cash flows are discounted to determine the current value of the projected claim payments. The timing and amount of payments on policyholder liabilities may vary significantly over time. \u2022 Payments related to our long-term debt and our facility agreements, which include contractual principal and interest payments and therefore exceeds the amount shown in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $6,536.4 million, of which $196.4 million in interest payments is estimated to be paid in 2024. \u2022 Investment commitments which represent commitments we have made to purchase or fund investments including privately placed fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage loans, and private equity partnerships totaled $925.2 million, all of which is estimated to be paid in 2024 based on the expiration date of the commitments.

Although changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities and derivatives due to changes in interest rates may impact amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets, these changes will not cause an economic gain or loss unless we sell investments, terminate derivative positions, determine that an investment is impaired, or determine that a derivative instrument is no longer an effective hedge.\nOther fixed rate investments, such as policy loans and mortgage loans, are carried at unpaid balances and amortized cost less the allowance for expected credit losses, respectively, rather than fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. These investments may have fair values substantially higher or lower than the carrying values reflected in our balance sheets. A change in interest rates could impact our financial position if we sold our mortgage loan investments at times of low market value. A change in interest rates would not impact our financial position at repayment of policy loans, as ultimately the cash surrender values or death benefits would be reduced for the carrying value of any outstanding policy loans. Carrying amounts for short-term investments approximate fair value, and we believe we have minimal interest rate risk exposure from these investments.\nWe believe that the risk of being forced to liquidate investments or terminate derivative positions is minimal, primarily due to the level of capital at our insurance subsidiaries, the level of cash and marketable securities at our holding companies, and our investment strategy which we believe provides for adequate cash flows to meet the funding requirements of our business. We may in certain circumstances, however, need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements, changes in tax laws, rating agency decisions, and/or unexpected changes in liquidity needs.\nAlthough our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments and we therefore have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities, the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk, which minimizes exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment cash flows with amounts due under insurance contracts. Changes in interest rates and individuals' behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows. We actively monitor our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to manage interest rate risk. Due to the long duration of our long-term care product, the timing of our investment cash flows do not match those of our maturing liabilities. We model and test asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields. Testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy, as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes. We use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments. We may use current and forward interest rate swaps, options on forward interest rate swaps, and forward treasury locks to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities.\nDebt is not carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. If we modify or replace existing debt instruments at current market rates, we may incur a gain or loss on the transaction. We believe our debt-related risk to changes in interest rates is relatively minimal.\nWe measure our insurance liabilities and financial instruments' market risk related to changes in interest rates using a sensitivity analysis. This analysis estimates potential changes in fair values as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 based on a hypothetical immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates from year end levels. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event.\nThe hypothetical potential changes in fair value of our insurance liabilities and financial instruments at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are shown as follows:\n1 These financial instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates may affect the fair value at which the item is reported in our consolidated balance sheets. The corresponding offsetting change is reported in other comprehensive income or loss, net of income tax, except for changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges or derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, together with the payment of periodic fees, if applicable, which are recognized in the same income statement line item as the hedged item during the period of change in fair value.\n2 The adoption of ASU 2018-12 required an update of the discount rate assumptions related to our liability for future policy benefits at each reporting date using a yield that is reflective of an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument, which is generally equivalent to a single-A interest rate matched to the duration of certain of our insurance liabilities. As such, the 99\nvalue of certain of our insurance liabilities may be adversely affected by changes in the single-A interest rate environment which could impact the valuation of our liability for future policy benefits and related reinsurance recoverable.\nThe effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a duration implied methodology for the fixed maturity securities whereby the duration of each security was used to estimate the change in price for the security assuming an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates. These hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value. The changes in the fair values shown in the chart above for all other items were determined using discounted cash flow analyses. Because we actively manage our investments and liabilities, actual changes could differ from those estimated above.\nOur overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of our insurance products. Assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities. We estimate that we will have approximately $1.5 billion of investable cash flows in 2024. Assuming interest rates and credit spreads remain constant throughout 2025 at the January 2024 market levels, our net investment income would increase by an immaterial amount in both 2024 and 2025 as a result of the investment of cash flows at levels above our current portfolio rate. This interest rate scenario does not give consideration to the effect of other factors which could impact these results, such as changes in the bond market and changes in hedging strategies and positions, nor does it consider the potential change to our discount rate reserve assumptions and any mitigating factors such as pricing adjustments.\nSee \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" contained herein in Item 7 for further information concerning our pension and post-retirement benefit plans.", "content": []}]}, {"title": "Foreign Currency Risk", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "The functional currency of our U.K. operations is the British pound sterling.

Realized investment gains or losses are based upon specific identification of the investments sold.\nInterest income is recorded as part of net investment income when earned, using an effective yield method giving effect to amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Included within fixed maturity securities are mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. We recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities. Actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically, and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected. The effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis, and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income. For fixed maturity securities on which collection of investment income is uncertain, we discontinue the accrual of investment income and recognize investment income when interest and dividends are received. Payment terms specified for fixed maturity securities may include a prepayment penalty for unscheduled payoff of the investment. Prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when received.\nIn determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is a credit loss, we evaluate available information, both positive and negative, in reaching our conclusions. In particular, we consider the strength of the issuer's balance sheet, its debt obligations and near-term funding requirements, cash flow and liquidity, the profitability of its core businesses, the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity, its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment, and its access to capital markets. Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security, whether we intend to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments represent credit losses. The significance of the decline in value is also an important factor, but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on this factor, since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security.\nFor securities with a decline in fair value below amortized cost which we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value, the amortized cost of the investment is written down to fair value through earnings, and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period.

Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan's contractual interest rate. Prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when received. For mortgage loans on which collection of interest income is uncertain, we discontinue the accrual of interest and recognize it in the period when an interest payment is received. We typically do not resume the accrual of interest on mortgage loans on nonaccrual status until there are significant improvements in the underlying financial condition of the borrower. We consider a loan to be delinquent if full payment is not received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan.\nWe evaluate each of our mortgage loans individually for impairment and assign an internal credit quality rating based on a comprehensive rating system used to evaluate the credit risk of the loan. Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios are the most critical factors in determining impairment. We estimate an allowance for credit losses that we expect to incur over the life of our mortgage loans using a probability of default method. For each loan, we estimate the probability that the loan will default before its maturity (probability of default) and the amount of the loss if the loan defaults (loss given default). These two factors result in an expected loss percentage that is applied to the amortized cost of each loan to determine the expected credit loss. As we are typically the original underwriter of the mortgage loans, the amortized cost generally equals the principal amount of the loan. We measure losses on defaults of our mortgage loans as the excess amortized cost of the mortgage loan over the fair value of the underlying collateral in the event that we foreclose on the loan or over the expected future cash flows of the loan if we retain the mortgage loan until payoff. We do not purchase mortgage loans with existing credit impairments.\nIn estimating the probability of default, we consider historical experience, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future market conditions. We utilize our historical loan experience in combination with a large third-party industry database for a period of time that aligns with the average life of our loans based on the maturity dates of the loans and prepayment experience. Our model utilizes an industry database of the historical loss experience based on our actual portfolio characteristics such as loan-to-value, debt service coverage, collateral type, geography, and late payment history. In addition, because we actively manage our portfolio, we may extend the term of a loan in certain situations and will accordingly extend the maturity date in the estimate of probability of default. In estimating the loss given default, we primarily consider the type and value of collateral and secondarily the expected liquidation costs and time to recovery.\nThe primary market factors that we consider in our forecast of future market conditions are gross domestic product, unemployment rates, interest rates, inflation, commercial real estate values, household formation, and retail sales. We also forecast certain loan specific factors such as growth in the fair value and net operating income of collateral by property type. We include our estimate of these factors over a two-year period and for the remainder of the loans\u2019 estimated lives, adjusted for estimated prepayments. Past the two-year forecast period, we revert to the historical assumptions ratably by the end of the fifth year of the loan after which we utilize only historical assumptions.\nWe utilize various scenarios to estimate our allowance for expected losses ranging from a base case scenario that reflects normal market conditions to a severe case scenario that reflects adverse market conditions. We will adjust our allowance each period to utilize the scenario or weighting of the scenarios that best reflects our view of current market conditions.

Assets or liabilities with readily available actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value.

DAC is amortized on a constant level basis over the life of the policy. For all products, in-force volume metrics are used as the constant level basis. The lapse and mortality assumptions used to amortize DAC for our traditional long-duration products are consistent with the assumptions used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits.

Liabilities for future policy benefits also include the related expenses for our non interest-sensitive life and accident and health products. The liability for future policy benefits is calculated based on the present value of the estimated future policy benefits less the present value of estimated future net premiums collected. Net premiums represent the portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses, excluding acquisition costs or any costs that are required to be charged to expense as incurred. In calculating the liability for future policy benefits, our long-duration contracts are grouped into cohorts by product type and contract issue year.\nThe calculation of the liability for future policy benefits involves numerous assumptions including assumptions related to discount rate, lapses, mortality, and morbidity. The discount rate assumptions were initially set based on the expected investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves at the transition date of accounting standards update (ASU) 2018-12, which was January 1, 2021, for policies originally issued on or before the transition date. The discount rate assumptions for new cohorts established after the transition date, are initially set based on the policy issuance date or policy renewal date, and are based on an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument, which is generally equivalent to a single-A interest rate matched to the duration of our insurance liabilities. As cohorts are grouped by product type and issue year, a weighted average discount rate is utilized as policies are issued or renewed throughout the year. We utilize a reference portfolio of fixed-income instruments that have been A-rated by one of the major credit rating agencies. For products with liability cash flows that exceed the duration of observable single-A fixed income instruments, we use the last market observable yield and use extrapolation approaches to determine yield assumptions for durations beyond the last market observable duration. For the discount rate assumptions for products in our Unum International segment, we utilize observable market data in the local debt markets in the UK and Poland.\nThe initial, also referred to as the original, discount rate assumptions established for each cohort are used to determine interest accretion which is reported as a component of policy benefits on the statements of income. After policy issuance or policy renewal, the discount rate assumptions are updated quarterly and used to update the liability at each reporting date to the current discount rate, with the corresponding change reflected as the change in the effect of discount rate assumptions on the liability for future policy benefits, net of reinsurance, on the statement of changes in other comprehensive income (loss). Policyholder lapse and mortality assumptions reflect the probability that an insureds\u2019 coverage is discontinued due to lapsation or death of the insured. For our life insurance products, mortality assumptions also reflect the probability that a benefit payment occurs. Policyholder lapse and mortality assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations. Claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to morbidity and mortality are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations. The claim incidence rate assumption is the rate at which new claims are submitted and the development of this assumption may involve many factors, including the age of the insured, the insured's occupation or industry, the benefit plan design, and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment. The claim resolution rate assumption is the probability that a claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured and is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid on an open claim. Certain product lines may utilize additional assumptions in calculating the liability for future policy benefits in addition to those listed above such as premium rate increases for long-term care, benefit offsets for long-term disability, and claim costs for voluntary benefits. Claim costs capture the combined effect of the incidence rate, the expected level of benefit to be paid, and the claim resolution rate. 118", "content": []}, {"title": "Unum Group and Subsidiaries", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "Cash flow assumptions are reviewed and updated, as needed, at least annually. Assumptions may be updated more frequently if necessary based on trending experience and future expectations. On a quarterly basis, cohort level cash flow measures are updated based on the emergence of actual experience. The updated cash flows are used to determine the updated net premiums and the net premium ratio, which is the present value of benefits and related expenses divided by the present value of gross premiums. The updated net premium ratio is used to calculate the updated liability for future policy benefits as of the beginning of the year, at the original discount rate. The change in the liability for future policy benefits, at the original discount rate, as of the beginning of the period, resulting from changes in cash flow assumptions and resulting from the emergence of actual experience from expected experience, is reflected as the policy benefits - remeasurement loss (gain) in the consolidated statements of income. The impact of all other changes in the liability for future policy benefits are reflected as policy benefits in the consolidated statements of income.\nFor most products, a net premium methodology is applied to each cohort to estimate the liability for claims not yet incurred in which discounted gross benefits are compared to discounted gross premiums. In this methodology, actual experience to date is combined with projected future cash flows to determine a net premium ratio for each cohort. The future cash flows include the costs of future expected claims as well as future cash flows on claims that have already been incurred. The net premium ratio is then used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits. The liability for future policy benefits represents the present value of future claims and associated expenses less the present value of future net premiums, which is derived by multiplying the present value of future gross premium by the net premium ratio.\nFor our group products in the Unum US and Unum International segments, we evaluate the liability for future policy benefits required for active policies in comparison to incurred claims. Given the term nature of the products, their renewal features, and level funding nature of the premium for these products, we have determined that the liability value is generally zero for policies that are not on claim. For these products, our liability for future policy benefit values are limited to the liability associated with claims incurred as of the valuation date.\nMultiple estimation methods exist to establish liabilities for the incurred claim component of future policy benefits. Available reserving methods utilized to calculate these liabilities include the tabular reserve method, the paid loss development method, the incurred loss development method, the count and severity method, and the expected claim cost method. No single method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines. The estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most accurate and reliable liability.\nWe use a tabular reserve methodology on reported claims for our Unum US group long-term disability and individual disability claims as well as for our Closed Block long-term care claims. Under the tabular reserve methodology, the liability for reported claims is based on certain characteristics of the actual reported claimants and their related policy provisions, such as age, length of time disabled, and medical diagnosis, as well as assumptions regarding claim duration, discount rate, and policy benefit offsets. We believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate long-term liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim. Incurred, but not reported (IBNR) liabilities for future policy benefits for our longer-term products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs. For Unum US group short-term disability products, an estimate of the value of future payments to be made on claims already submitted, as well as on IBNR claims, is determined in aggregate using a paid loss development method rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for reported claims on longer-term products. The average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products and results in less estimation variability.\nLiabilities for claims for Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid, IBNR death claims, and a liability for waiver of premium benefits in the event the policyholder becomes disabled. The death claim liability is based on the actual face amount to be paid, the IBNR liability is calculated using the count and severity method based on historical patterns of the claims, and the waiver of premium benefits liability is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology.\nLiabilities for claims related to the group and individual dental and vision products reported in our Unum US and Colonial Life segments have a short claim payout period.

Our liabilities for future policy benefits for these lines of business are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience.

The most significant impact is related to our longest duration products. Our investment strategy reflects the illiquid nature of the majority of our liability cash flows and, as a result, the yields in our investment portfolios supporting the cash outflows required for these products are generally higher than a single-A yield. In addition, the discount rates applied under the historical accounting method to the reserves for our longest duration products, such as long-term care, included an assumption for long-term yields rising to more historical levels.\nThe net favorable impact of the adoption of ASU 2018-12 to net income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022 shown in the preceding charts is due primarily to the following changes:\n\u2022 Updating the lifetime cohort net premium ratios, or lifetime loss ratio, for actual experience each reporting period will generally cause earnings patterns to be more consistent from period to period, with variances in experience reflected in earnings over the cohort lifetime. This resulted in an unfavorable impact to income for 2021 and 2022.\n\u2022 Alignment of amortization of deferred acquisition costs to a constant level basis and modification of amortization periods to reflect the expected term of the related contracts could result in either higher or lower income for the affected product lines. This resulted in a net favorable impact to income for 2021 and 2022.\n\u2022 Accelerated recognition of the provision for adverse deviation or other differences from current best estimate values for policies issued prior to the transition date and due to not establishing the provision for policies issued on or after the transition date will generally result in higher income most notably in the initial years after the transition date. This resulted in a favorable impact to income for 2021 and 2022.\n\u2022 Establishing reserves for claims incurred on or after the transition date at interest rates prescribed by the update could result in either higher or lower income for the affected product lines depending on the policy issue date and the interest rate environment at that time. This resulted in an unfavorable impact to income for 2021 and a favorable impact to income for 2022.\n\u2022 Updating cash flow assumptions could result in either higher or lower income. This resulted in a favorable impact to income for 2021 and 2022.\n\u2022 Accounting for non-contemporaneous reinsurance related to the second phase of our Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction which was completed in the first quarter of 2021. This resulted in an increase in policy benefits resulting from the realization of previously unrealized investment gains and losses previously recorded in AOCI that was removed as of the transition date which had a favorable impact on income for 2021. As a result of the execution of the second phase of the reinsurance transaction occurring after January 1, 2021, the transition date of ASU 2018-12, in accordance with the provisions of the ASU related to non-contemporaneous reinsurance, we were required to establish the ceded reserves using an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument as of the reinsurance transaction date in March 2021 which resulted in higher ceded reserves compared to that which was reported historically. However, the direct reserves for the block reinsured in the second phase were calculated using the original discount rate utilized as of the transition date. Both the direct and ceded reserves are then remeasured at each reporting period using a current discount rate reflective of an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument, with the changes recognized in OCI. While the total equity impact is neutral, the different original discount rates utilized for direct and ceded reserves result in disproportionate earnings impacts. The differential in the original discount rate applied to the direct and ceded cohorts of business resulted in an unfavorable impact to income for 2021 and 2022, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of the cost of reinsurance as a result of a lower cost of reinsurance. 129", "content": []}]}, {"title": "Unum Group and Subsidiaries", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "", "content": [{"title": "Accounting Updates Adopted in 2022:", "text": "", "content": []}]}]}]}]}, {"title": "ASU 2020-06, Debt\u2014Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging\u2014Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "The amendments in this update simplified the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in the guidance related to convertible instruments and expanded related disclosure requirements.

Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value. An active market for a financial instrument is a market in which transactions for an asset or a similar asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value whenever available. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that require more judgment. Pricing observability is generally impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, and overall market conditions.\nWe classify financial instruments in accordance with a fair value hierarchy consisting of three levels based on the observability of valuation inputs:\n\u2022 Level 1 - the highest category of the fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\n\u2022 Level 2 - valued using inputs (other than prices included in Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life.\n\u2022 Level 3 - the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date.

The market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach converts future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount. The cost approach is based upon the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset, or the current replacement cost.\nWe use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available that can be obtained without undue cost and effort. In some cases, a single valuation technique will be appropriate (for example, when valuing an asset or liability using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities). In other cases, multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate. If we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value, we evaluate and weigh the results, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results. A fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances.\nThe selection of the valuation method(s) to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued. For assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, and to a lesser extent, the income approach. We believe the market approach provides more observable data than the income approach, considering the type of investments we hold. Our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs. When using a pricing service, we obtain the vendor's pricing documentation to ensure we understand their methodologies. We periodically review and approve the selection of our pricing vendors to ensure we are in agreement with their current methodologies. When markets are less active, brokers may rely more on models with inputs based on the information available only to the broker. Our internal investment management professionals, which include portfolio managers and analysts, monitor securities priced by brokers and evaluate their prices for reasonableness based on benchmarking to available primary and secondary market information. In weighing a broker quote as an input to fair value, we place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions. We also consider the nature of the quote, particularly whether it is a bid or market quote. If prices in an inactive market do not reflect current prices for the same or similar assets, adjustments may be necessary to arrive at fair value.

Additionally, an adjustment to the price derived from a model typically reflects our judgment of the inputs that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would consider in pricing that same financial instrument.

A total return swap is an agreement in which we pay a floating rate of interest to the counterparty and receive the total return on a portfolio of mutual funds and exchange traded funds.

The market risk of the derivatives should generally offset the market risk associated with the hedged financial instrument or liability. To help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives, we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position. We also typically enter into bilateral, cross-collateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives. These agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount. Credit exposure on derivatives is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, including accrued interest receivable less collateral held.

Liabilities for future policy benefits also include the related expenses for our non interest-sensitive life and accident and health products. The liability for future policy benefits is calculated based on the present value of the estimated future policy benefits less the present value of estimated future net premiums collected. Net premiums represent the portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses, excluding acquisition costs or any costs that are required to be charged to expense as incurred. In calculating the liability for future policy benefits, our long-duration contracts are grouped into cohorts by product type and contract issue year.\nThe calculation of the liability for future policy benefits involves numerous assumptions including assumptions related to discount rate, lapses, mortality, and morbidity. Cash flow assumptions are reviewed and updated, as needed, at least annually. Assumptions may be updated more frequently if necessary based on trending experience and future expectations. On a quarterly basis, cohort level cash flow measures are updated based on the emergence of actual experience.\nThe initial, also referred to as the original, discount rate assumptions established for each cohort are used to determine interest accretion. After policy issuance or policy renewal, the discount rate assumptions are updated quarterly and used to update the liability at each reporting date to the current discount rate. The weighted average current discount rate was 4.8 percent at December 31, 2023, 5.0 percent at December 31, 2022, and 2.5 percent at December 31, 2021. The discount rate was lower at December 31, 2023 relative to December 31, 2022 due primarily to a decrease in credit spreads. The discount rate was higher at December 31, 2022 relative to December 31, 2021 due to an increase in U.S. Treasury rates.\nDuring our annual cash flow assumption review in 2023, we updated certain of our assumptions used to develop the liability for future policy benefits which resulted in a net increase to the liability. The increase to the liability for future policy benefits was driven primarily by assumption updates in the Closed Block long-term care product line, partially offset by assumption updates in the Unum US group disability product line and in the Colonial Life segment. The long-term care assumption updates were primarily driven by lower expectations for active policy lapse and mortality assumptions, partially offset by an increase to expected future premium rate increases. The Unum US group disability product line assumption updates were primarily related to claim resolution assumptions driven by favorable claim recovery trends, while the Colonial Life segment assumption updates were driven by improved claim cost assumptions and increases in policyholder lapse rates.\nDuring our annual cash flow assumption review in 2022, we updated certain of our assumptions used to develop the liability for future policy benefits which resulted in a net increase to the liability. The increase to the liability for future policy benefits was driven primarily by assumption updates related to the reinsured portion of our Closed Block segment, mostly offset by assumption updates in the Unum US segment and the Colonial Life segment. The Closed Block segment assumption updates related to the reinsured portion of our all other product line primarily included updates to mortality assumptions for the advanced age portion of our individual disability claimant population. This advanced age claimant population was included in the block ceded as a part of the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction with Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company. As a result, a corresponding increase was reported in our consolidated balance sheet as a reinsurance recoverable related to these assumption updates. The Unum US segment assumption updates were primarily driven by sustained improvement in claim recovery trends in our group disability and group life product lines, partially offset by lower social security benefit offsets in our group disability product line. The Colonial Life segment assumption updates were primarily driven by improved claim cost assumptions.\nDuring our annual cash flow assumption review in 2021, we updated certain of our assumptions used to develop the liability for future policy benefits which resulted in a net decrease to the liability. The decrease to the liability for future policy benefits was driven primarily by assumption updates in the Unum US group disability product line due primarily to sustained improvement in the claim recovery trends since our last assumption update.\nActual variance from expected experience for 2023 was due primarily to the Unum US group disability, Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment, Unum US individual disability, and Closed Block long-term care product lines.

In 2021, Northwind Re obtained a Certificate of Dormancy from the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation authorizing it to exist as a dormant captive insurance company, leaving Fairwind as the only remaining active captive reinsurer. Northwind Re was merged with one of our non-insurance U.S. holding companies, Northwind Holdings, with Northwind Holdings remaining as the surviving company. Subsequently during 2022, Northwind Holdings was merged into Unum Group.\nThe operating results and capital and surplus of our traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries and our captive reinsurers, prepared in accordance with prescribed or permitted accounting practices of the NAIC or states of domicile, are presented separately below.\nSolvency II, a European Union directive that is part of retained U.K. law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, prescribes capital requirements and risk management standards for the European insurance industry. As derived from the most recent annual financial statements for December 31, 2022, based on Solvency II requirements, regulatory net income and eligible own funds available of our United Kingdom insurance subsidiary, Unum Limited, were \u00a3 569.2 million and \u00a3 622.7 million, respectively.\nRisk-based capital (RBC) standards for U.S. life insurance companies are prescribed by the NAIC. The domiciliary states of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries have all adopted a version of the RBC model formula of the NAIC, which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers. The basis of the system is a risk-based formula that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurer's business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer. The life and health RBC formula is designed to measure annually (i) the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations, (ii) the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience, (iii) the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates, and (iv) business risks. The formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized. State insurance laws grant insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. The total adjusted capital of each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2023 is in excess of those RBC levels.", "content": []}]}, {"title": "Unum Group and Subsidiaries", "text": "", "content": [{"text": "Restrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any 12-month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities.

The payment of dividends to a parent company from a life insurance subsidiary is generally further limited to the amount of unassigned funds.\nBased on the restrictions under current law, approximately $ 1,289 million is available, without prior approval by regulatory authorities, during 2024 for the payment of dividends to Unum Group from its traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries.
