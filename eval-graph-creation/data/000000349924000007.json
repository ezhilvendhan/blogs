In the discussion below, when we refer to Vornado\u2019s buildings, it includes our buildings.\nVornado is an industry leader in sustainability, owning and operating more than 25 million square feet of LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified buildings, representing 95% of its in-service office portfolio, with over 24 million square feet at LEED Gold or Platinum. In 2023, Vornado (i) ranked #1 in the US Diversified Office/Retail REIT peer group by GRESB, and received the \u201cGreen Star\u201d distinction for the eleventh consecutive year and GRESB's five star rating, (ii) received the Leader in the Light Award by the National Association for Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) for diversified REITs for the thirteenth time, and (iii) was recognized as an EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year with the distinction of having demonstrated eight years of sustained excellence.\nVornado prioritizes addressing climate change and in 2019 adopted a 10-year plan to make its buildings carbon neutral by 2030 (\u201cVision 2030\u201d). Vision 2030 is a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes energy reduction, recovery, and renewable power. Vornado relies on technology, as well as meaningful stakeholder collaboration with its tenants, its employees, and its communities, to achieve this plan. Vornado\u2019s commitment to carbon neutrality and associated emissions reduction targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative as consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C climate scenario, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.\nVornado considers sustainability in all aspects of its business, including the design, construction, retrofitting and ongoing maintenance and operations of its portfolio of buildings. Vornado operates its buildings sustainably and efficiently by seeking to establish best practices in energy and water consumption, carbon reduction, resource and waste management and ecologically sensitive procurement. Vornado\u2019s policies, from 100% green cleaning to procuring 100% renewable electricity certificates to energy efficiency, are implemented across its entire portfolio. Vornado undertakes significant outreach with its tenants, employees and investors regarding Vornado\u2019s sustainability programs and strategies.\nVornado gathers data to measure progress against its goals, aligns its goals with its tenants, plans for its longer-term projects and engages with its stakeholders in meaningful ways. Vornado uses carbon accounting software, energy audits and models and building automation software to measure and track its portfolio-wide waste, water and energy reduction strategies, create roadmaps for each building to understand how to achieve carbon neutrality and provide accurate and actionable data for its measurement, verification and reporting requirements.\nVornado\u2019s 2022 and 2023 long-term performance plan awards specifically tie a portion of senior management\u2019s compensation to the achievement of certain ESG targets, including reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, achieving a specified GRESB score and targeting a specified percentage of LEED Gold or Platinum certified square footage in its office portfolio.\nVornado is committed to transparent reporting of sustainability performance indicators and publishes an annual ESG Report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative and aligned with the metrics codified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and in 2023 published a report in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.

Maintenance and repairs are generally expensed as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. We capitalize all property operating expenses directly associated with and attributable to, the development and construction of a project, including interest expense. The capitalization period begins when development activities are underway and ends when it is determined that the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, which is typically evidenced by the receipt of a temporary certificate of occupancy. General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.\nOur properties are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset, including an estimated terminal value calculated using an appropriate capitalization rate. Estimates of future cash flows are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. For our development properties, estimates of future cash flows also include all future expenditures necessary to develop the asset, including interest payments that will be capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and is measured based on the excess of the property\u2019s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. If our estimates of future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or fair values change, based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
